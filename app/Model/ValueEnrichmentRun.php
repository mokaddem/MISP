/**
 * What a module last answered about a value, per organisation.
 *
 * Phase 11 of prd/analyst-profile/ (`13-auto-run.md` §4). D15 named a
 * per-value per-module last-run store as the thing auto-run could not
 * be built without, and nothing built it: `Module` is
 * `useTable = false`, so until this table nothing anywhere in MISP
 * recorded that a module had been asked about anything.
 *
 * ## It is not only auto-run's store (D25)
 *
 * Every run writes here — a press as much as an auto — and every
 * module row on the Enrichment tab reads it. `max_age_hours` was
 * always defined as *the reuse window*, not as an automation window,
 * and the auto-run gate defaults off, so a store that served only
 * `auto` would hand every instance a migration and no benefit. What
 * this buys instead is memory on a tab whose own docblock apologised
 * for having none.
 *
 * A press still always re-runs (§5). The window governs what happens
 * *without* a press.
 *
 * ## One row per (org, value, module, type)
 *
 * UPSERTed, so a module asked a thousand times about one value is one
 * row. The table therefore grows with the breadth of investigation
 * rather than with its depth, and §4.4's retention is about values
 * nobody returned to rather than about runaway writes.
 *
 * **Per organisation**, because that is exactly how far MISP's own
 * ACL reaches: `MispAttribute::buildConditions()` caches on
 * `perm_site_admin . '-' . org_id` and nothing finer, and
 * `Module::canUse()` reserves a module with `_restrict` against
 * `org_id`. Instance-wide storage would surface a reserved module's
 * output to an organisation the instance withheld it from; per-user
 * storage would spend the quota once per analyst.
 *
 * The site-admin half of that ACL key is deliberately **not** here,
 * because the one reader-dependent thing in a run — the *already in
 * MISP* chips — is recomputed on read rather than stored (§8.1).
 *
 * ## What is stored, and what is not
 *
 * The shaped run, post-cap and pre-chips. Post-cap because
 * `ValueProfile::ENRICHMENT_ELEMENT_CAP` already bounds a result at
 * 200 elements while preserving `total`, and that cap is the
 * difference between a bounded row and the 1,374 objects
 * `circl_passivedns` returns for `8.8.8.8`. Pre-chips because
 * `enrichmentKnown()` answers *"already in MISP **and** you can see
 * it"* about the database as it is right now, and a frozen answer
 * becomes an answer about the database an hour ago.
 *
 * **`user_id` is stored and never rendered (D27).** Who asked is
 * useful for an audit and for diagnosing a purge; showing it tells the
 * organisation which colleague is looking at which value.
