/**
 * Which certificates have been served from an address, and when they
 * were valid.
 *
 * The `x509` template is the widest one this page draws from — around
 * sixty relations — and almost all of them are about the key rather
 * than about the host. What a reader wants from a set of certificates
 * is the validity windows and the subjects: a certificate issued last
 * week on an address that has been quiet for a year is the finding.
 *
 * **The validity window is the ordering key and not the answer's
 * age.** A certificate object carries no observation date, so a set
 * sorted by when the module ran would put a decade-old certificate
 * above one issued yesterday whenever the older answer was fetched
 * second.
