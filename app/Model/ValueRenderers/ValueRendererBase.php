/**
 * What a value renderer is: a class that turns one enrichment answer
 * into something a person can read at a glance.
 *
 * The Overview's enrichment panel summarises a module's answer as
 * chips — `country United States`, `1,374 passive-dns` — and that
 * summary was always a placeholder. It reads well for a module that
 * answered with four relations and says almost nothing for one that
 * answered with a thousand. What an analyst wants from a geolocation
 * answer is a map, from a passive-DNS answer a timeline, and from a
 * verdict a ratio; none of that is derivable from a chip.
 *
 * ## Keyed on the shape of the answer, never on the module
 *
 * A renderer claims one or more **MISP object template names** and is
 * chosen when the answer carries one. Three keys were available and
 * only this one survives contact with the data:
 *
 * - *By module* — there are over a hundred expansion modules and
 *   contributors add more. A roster mapping each to a layout is a
 *   maintenance list that is wrong the week after it is written.
 * - *By attribute type* — `ip-src` is declared by dozens of modules,
 *   which all answer different questions about it. One fixed layout
 *   per type is the wrong layout for most of them.
 * - *By returned shape* — a `geolocation` object is a map whether it
 *   came from `mmdb_lookup`, `geoip_city` or `ipinfo`. A set of
 *   `passive-dns` relations carrying dates is a timeline whoever
 *   fetched it.
 *
 * The object template name is the stable contract both sides of the
 * request already share, and it is user-extensible: an organisation
 * that defines its own object and runs a module returning it gets a
 * widget by dropping a file in, without patching core.
 *
 * **A module returning a bare `text` relation matches no shape and
 * keeps its chip.** That is the honest fallback and is explicitly not
 * a defect.
 *
 * **Two shapes claim a set of templates rather than one name**, because
 * the ecosystem answers the same question with different templates:
 * a reputation verdict arrives as `greynoise-ip`, `abuseipdb` or
 * `crowdsec-ip-context`, and a file verdict as `virustotal-report` or
 * `google-threat-intelligence-report`. Verdict vendors do not share a
 * template — each ships its own — so for those two shapes the set is a
 * per-vendor list until a generic one exists upstream. The key is
 * still the template and never the module.
 *
 * ## Discovery, and the five rules that come with it
 *
 * Renderers are **discovered from the filesystem**, the third subject
 * to be: the shipped ones live beside this file, an instance admin
 * drops their own in `app/Lib/ValueRenderers/`, and every rule the
 * loader already applies to signals and to escalations applies here.
 *
 * 1. **Discovery is not activation.** Dropping a renderer in changes
 *    nothing until a profile ranks its shape. Nothing moves on the
 *    instance because a file appeared.
 * 2. **A colliding claim is refused, not overridden.** Shipped files
 *    load first and keep their templates; a custom file claiming a
 *    template already claimed is logged and skipped. Two renderers for
 *    one shape would mean two instances drawing the same answer
 *    differently — so the uniqueness here is on `$templates` as well
 *    as on `$id`.
 * 3. **A broken file is an honest state, never a fatal.** It does not
 *    parse, the class is missing, the class is not a renderer: logged,
 *    skipped, the shape unavailable, and the reason kept for the
 *    editor.
 * 4. **One scan per request, no cache across requests.**
 * 5. **Nothing in the UI ever writes one of these files.**
 *
 * ## The class to write
 *
 * ```php
 * class GeolocationRenderer extends ValueRendererBase
 * {
 *     public $id = 'geolocation';
 *     public $templates = array('geolocation', 'ip-api-address');
 *     public $compact = 'Values/Renderers/geolocation_compact';
 *     public $full = 'Values/Renderers/geolocation_full';
 *
 *     public function matches(array $objects, array $attributes)
 *     {
 *         return $this->firstWith($objects, 'country') !== null;
 *     }
 *
 *     public function prepare(array $objects, array $attributes)
 *     {
 *         return array('points' => …);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `matches()` exists so a renderer can **decline an answer that
 * carries its template but not the fields it needs**. A `passive-dns`
 * object with no dates cannot be a timeline, and drawing an empty
 * chart is worse than keeping the chip. Declining is not an error and
 * is not reported anywhere: the answer simply stays a chip.
 *
 * `prepare()` returns the view's data and is **where every computation
 * lives**. A template that computes is how two surfaces start to
 * disagree, and the compact and full forms of one shape are two
 * surfaces over one answer; with the arithmetic in one function they
 * cannot drift.
 *
 * **Both templates are pure.** They take `prepare()`'s output and
 * nothing else — no model calls, no requests, no `Configure::read`.
 * The one thing that looks like an exception is the map, and it is
 * not one: tiles are fetched by the reader's browser from the
 * instance's configured tile server, which is already how the event
 * view's geolocation popover works, and whether to draw a map at all
 * is decided in `prepare()` rather than in the template.
 *
 * ## What arrives in `$objects`
 *
 * The enrichment run shapes a module's answer into objects and
 * attributes, and the caller hands over **only the objects whose
 * template this renderer claims**, from every run it has for the
 * value, each tagged with where it came from:
 *
 * ```
 * name          string   the object template name
 * meta_category string|null
 * description   string|null
 * comment       string|null
 * attributes    [['relation','type','value','category','comment',
 *                 'to_ids','correlates','known'], …]
 * module        string   which module answered — added by the caller
 * ran_at        int      when it answered, unix seconds — likewise
 * ```
 *
 * `module` and `ran_at` are not part of a module's answer and are not
 * stored with one. They are added on the way in because a full
 * rendering that merges three modules' geolocation points has to be
 * able to say which point came from where, and because the newest
 * answer is the one that takes a slot.
 *
 * `$attributes` is the same run's top-level attributes, for a shape
 * whose answer is not an object. Most renderers ignore it.
