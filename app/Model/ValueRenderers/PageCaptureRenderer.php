/**
 * What a URL looked like when somebody fetched it.
 *
 * **One module draws this today, and it is a keyed one.**
 * `rst_screenshot` emits an `image` object with the PNG attached, so
 * a reader whose instance has that key sees the widget. The free
 * answers are still prose: `sourcecache` holds the page bytes as an
 * attachment and emits no object, and `urlscan` holds a screenshot
 * URL, a title and a server banner and emits none of it.
 *
 * **`page-capture` is claimed here in advance**, the way `reputation`
 * is. `image` carries a picture and no date and `domain-crawled`
 * carries the URLs a crawl found rather than what they returned, so
 * neither can say *when* a page looked like this — which is the one
 * fact a capture is read for. The day a template for the capture
 * itself lands, the two conversions have somewhere to emit that
 * already has a widget.
 *
 * **A capture with no image is still a capture.** An archived copy and
 * its extracted text are what a disinformation reader came for as much
 * as the picture is, so the widget draws a thumbnail where there is
 * one and the URL and its date where there is not.
