/**
 * What a name resolved to, and when.
 *
 * Three templates answer this and only one of them carries dates.
 * `passive-dns` has `time_first` and `time_last`; `domain-ip` has
 * `first-seen` and `last-seen` where whoever built it filled them in;
 * `dns-record` is a live lookup and has no dates at all.
 *
 * **An undated resolution is a set, not a timeline.** The obvious
 * reading — decline anything without dates, so the widget is always a
 * chart — throws away the one resolution answer every stock instance
 * has, because `dns` and `reversedns` are what an instance with no
 * passive-DNS subscription runs. So `matches()` accepts them and the
 * compact form draws the addresses as a set with a count: no
 * sparkline, no axis, and no pretence that an undated answer is a
 * history.
 *
 * `count` on a `passive-dns` object is how many times that resolution
 * was observed, and it is the weight behind a line rather than a
 * number of rows — a resolution seen forty thousand times and one
 * seen twice are both one row here.
