/**
 * Where an identifier has an account, and where it has been exposed.
 *
 * **`socialscan` emits this, free and unauthenticated.** It returns
 * one `user-account` per platform the identifier was found on, with
 * the platform as `account-type` and the identifier itself as the
 * handle — `username` where it was asked for a name, `email` and
 * `user-id` where it was asked for an address. A platform that
 * answered *available*, or that failed, produces no object, so the
 * objects are the hits and nothing else.
 *
 * No `link` is emitted: the module knows a platform holds the account
 * and not where it lives, and a URL guessed from a platform name is a
 * link that sometimes 404s. `accountOf()` reads one where a richer
 * producer sends it.
 *
 * **One object is one platform.** The set is the answer — *found on
 * six of the eleven checked* — so the count is the headline and the
 * platforms are the detail, which is the inverse of most shapes here.
 *
 * **`breach` is absorbed here rather than given a shape of its own**
 * (PRD 1 §3.2, decided 2026-09-18). A breach is where an address was
 * found, which is the question this shape answers; an eighteenth shape
 * would draw a second widget saying the same thing more narrowly and
 * take a slot from the strip to do it. `hibp` and `xposedornot` both
 * emit the template.
 *
 * **The two are counted apart and never summed.** An account is a
 * place the identifier is; a breach is a place it leaked from, and the
 * identifier need not have had an account there at all. `count` stays
 * accounts, because that is what it has always meant and what the
 * strip's *n accounts* reads off; breaches have their own count and
 * their own table.
 *
 * **Breaches arrive in bulk.** Measured against `xposedornot` on one
 * address: 214 breach objects in one answer. So the compact form never
 * lists them, the full form caps what it draws, and the headline is
 * the count plus the one fact that changes what a reader does about
 * it — whether passwords were among what was exposed.
 *
 * **No breach object draws no breach line — never *0 breaches*.** A
 * renderer is handed the objects that matched its templates and
 * nothing else, so a value nobody asked a breach service about and a
 * value a service found nothing on arrive here identically: as an
 * absence. Both modules return an error rather than an empty answer
 * when they find nothing, which means even the run that did happen
 * leaves no object behind. *0 breaches* would therefore be a claim
 * this shape cannot support, and the templates state the count only
 * when there is one to state.
