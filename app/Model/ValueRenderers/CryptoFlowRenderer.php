/**
 * What has moved through a wallet.
 *
 * **`btc_steroids` emits this, free and unauthenticated.** It returns
 * a `btc-wallet` carrying the balance and the totals received and
 * sent, and one `btc-transaction` per movement carrying its time, its
 * net value to this wallet, and the addresses on both sides. The fiat
 * values are sent only where the rate for that day could be fetched.
 *
 * Four templates are claimed because the ecosystem splits the same
 * answer two ways: a wallet and its transactions as separate objects,
 * or one chain-agnostic address object carrying its own totals.
 *
 * **A transaction's counterparties are the addresses that are not the
 * wallet's own.** `btc-address` is a repeating relation, and the
 * producer sends the wallet being described first and whoever it
 * exchanged value with after it — so reading one address gives the
 * page the value it is already on, which is the one address that
 * cannot be pivoted to. The wallet object is what says which one that
 * is, and where a producer sends transactions with no wallet beside
 * them there is no privileged address and every party is a
 * counterparty.
