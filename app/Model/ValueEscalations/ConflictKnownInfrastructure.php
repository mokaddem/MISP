/**
 * MISP knows the value as shared infrastructure, and organisations
 * report it as a threat anyway.
 *
 * The contradiction that was on screen before anything computed it, and
 * the reason the warninglist signal weights a `known` hit at zero
 * rather than netting it off against the reporting. Both facts are
 * true: the value really is a CDN front or a hosting range, *and*
 * several organisations really did put it in an event with `to_ids`
 * set. Neither discounts the other.
 *
 * What arithmetic would do with that pair is pick the heavier side, and
 * both answers it can reach are wrong. Calling it a threat hides that
 * the value cannot be attributed to one tenant, so a reader blocks a
 * CDN edge. Calling it benign hides that people are reporting it, so a
 * reader stops looking at the one value several of their peers thought
 * worth flagging. The honest answer is the contradiction itself, which
 * is what this rule emits.
 *
 * **A single report is not a contradiction**, which is what
 * `min_independent_reports` is for. One organisation tagging a CDN
 * address is a mistake in one event, and a page that escalated on it
 * would escalate on every large hosting range MISP has ever seen. Three
 * organisations arriving at the same value independently is a pattern,
 * and a pattern against a `known` list is worth a reader's attention.
