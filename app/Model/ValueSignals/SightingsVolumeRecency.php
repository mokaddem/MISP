/**
 * How much this value has been seen, and how recently.
 *
 * Volume and recency in one row rather than two — *"47 sightings from
 * 4 orgs, last 2 days ago"* — because they are not independent
 * readings: four hundred
 * sightings that all stopped a year ago is one statement, not a strong
 * one and a weak one to be netted.
 *
 * **Logarithmic in volume, and that is the judgement.** The step from
 * 1 sighting to 10 says far more than the step from 400 to 410, so the
 * contribution saturates: `saturation` is the count at which the signal
 * is fully paid, and everything beyond it is worth the cap: with
 * `cap 24` and `saturation 50`, 47 sightings and 418 both land at
 * +24.
 *
 * **Recency is a factor, not an addend**, so it cannot rescue a value
 * nobody has seen: a stale sighting history scales the whole row down
 * rather than subtracting a fixed penalty from it.
 *
 * Absence fires as `none_recent`, and only on genuine absence — a
 * sighting set an exclusion emptied is not a value nobody sighted, and
 * `ValueSignalBase::absenceFires()` is where that rule lives.
 *
 * **Trust-weighted** — a sighting is
 * attributable to an organisation, so the count that feeds the
 * saturation curve becomes a *weighted* count of sightings. It goes in
 * before the logarithm rather than after it, because a factor applied
 * to the finished points would discount a `D`-graded organisation's
 * four hundred sightings by a quarter, where discounting the *count*
 * puts them where four hundred quarter-weight sightings belong on the
 * curve: the whole judgement in this signal is that volume saturates,
 * and a weighting that skipped the curve would not be weighting
 * volume.
