/**
 * Whether MISP already knows this value is not worth acting on.
 *
 * Typically the heaviest single row on a benign value, and the one
 * whose meaning depends entirely on **which kind of list matched** —
 * which is why the category resolution is a profile section of its
 * own.
 *
 * Two readings, and conflating them is the mistake this signal exists
 * to avoid:
 *
 * - **`false_positive`** — the list means *this is not an indicator*.
 *   A resolver address, an RFC1918 range, a top-1000 domain. Heavy
 *   negative points; the list is a judgement MISP ships.
 * - **`known`** — the list means *this is shared infrastructure*. A CDN
 *   front, a hosting range. It is not a false positive and it does not
 *   argue the value is harmless; it argues that the value cannot be
 *   attributed to one tenant. The default weight is therefore **zero**
 *   — the row is on the page saying so, counted for neither side, and
 *   the contradiction with wide reporting is named by an escalation
 *   rather than netted off in arithmetic.
 *
 * **A category nothing sets, today.** Upstream lists carry no
 * `category` and `Warninglist::__updateList()` drops the field on
 * import, so the resolution comes from the profile's
 * `reference.warninglist_category` override map, then from
 * `WarninglistCategory`'s name map, and only then from the table's own
 * column. Where nothing resolves, an unresolved hit reads as
 * `false_positive` — which is what MISP's own warning banner has always
 * meant by a hit, and the honest default until upstream lists carry
 * the field.
 *
 * Absence fires as `no_hit`: *"no warninglist hit, 84 lists checked"*
 * — and the lists checked is half of it: a hit against nothing is only
 * meaningful beside how much was looked at.

     * **`no_hit` does not, and that is the whole reason the axis is

     * case: it says the value is on no list MISP ships, which is not
     * the same statement as *the value is a threat*. Anchored, it
