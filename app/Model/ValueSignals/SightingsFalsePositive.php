/**
 * Somebody who looked at this value said it was wrong.
 *
 * The clearest negative evidence MISP holds, and the row that carries
 * the benign fixture value: eleven false-positive sightings on
 * `8.8.8.8`, worth −26 threat-signed, which the benign lean's polarity
 * renders as **+26 supporting benign** without the declaration
 * changing (§2, `04-dispositions.md` §2).
 *
 * **Capped, because a false positive is a judgement and not a
 * measurement.** One organisation can file forty; the cap is what stops
 * that outweighing every other signal on the page, and the row names
 * the organisations so a reader can see whether the forty were one
 * voice.
 *
 * **Silent on absence, deliberately.** No false positive is the normal
 * state of nearly every value on an instance, and a ledger row saying
 * so on all of them is noise that would drown the rows that mean
 * something. The catalogue's *fires on absence: no* (§6) is this
 * decision.
 *
 * **Trust-weighted** (`07-reference.md` §2.4) — a false positive from
 * a `D`-graded source is weaker evidence, and the weighting reaches
 * both halves of the arithmetic: the filings become a weighted count of
 * filings, and the extra-organisation term becomes `Σ factor − 1`,
 * which is `orgs − 1` exactly when nobody is graded. That second half
 * is what makes a `G` grade mean what §2.3 says it means — an
 * organisation whose evidence counts for nothing contributes no
 * filings *and* does not count as another voice, so it cannot
 * whitewash a value it controls by filing from one desk.
