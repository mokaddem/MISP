/**
 * How recently anybody reported this value.
 *
 * The quality reading of age, and deliberately not the relevance axis.
 * Relevance asks *does this still matter today* and answers with a TTL,
 * a runway and an expiry (`06-staleness.md`); this asks the narrower
 * question a ledger can answer — **is the record still being added
 * to** — and pays a few points for a yes.
 *
 * Keeping both is not double-counting, because they read different
 * clocks. Relevance runs off the last *independent corroboration* and
 * can expire a value nobody has re-reported; this runs off the last
 * occurrence of any kind, so a value one organisation keeps re-encoding
 * scores here and still ages out there. Where they agree, they agree in
 * different vocabulary on different axes; where they disagree, the
 * disagreement is the interesting thing and both are on screen.
 *
 * **Interpolated between the two ends**, so there is no cliff: a value
 * last reported the day after `recent_days` is worth marginally less
 * than one reported the day before it, not `recent` less. A cliff in a
 * ledger row is a place where two readers with the same evidence and
 * one day between their page loads get materially different numbers.
