/**
 * Whether the record can date its own observations.
 *
 * The quality reading of the fact that makes the relevance axis say
 * *timeline uncertain*: no `first_seen` on any occurrence, so nothing
 * records when the value was seen — only when its row was last
 * written.
 *
 * Take a phishing URL encoded two months after the incident.
 * Relevance says *the timeline is uncertain*; this says the quieter
 * thing next to it — **a record that cannot date its own observations
 * is a weaker record** — and the two readings have separate homes.
 *
 * **It does not measure encoding lag.** `Event.date` against
 * `Attribute.timestamp` looks like one and is not: `timestamp` is
 * last-modified — an edit, a tag, a sync update or a delete bumps it —
 * and `Event.date` is typed by an analyst, so it carries the same delay
 * the measurement would be looking for. MISP stores no created date for
 * an attribute at all.
 *
 * **Aggregate evidence, not row evidence.** The fact arrives as a
 * single-row `SUM` over `first_seen`, so it is cheap at any
 * cardinality and is read whole-history like every other aggregate.
 * A hot value keeps this row when the sighting and galaxy
 * signals bow out, which is the right way round: what it measures is
 * how honest the record's dates are, and that is exactly the sort of
 * thing worth knowing about a value too big to read.
