/**
 * Whether anybody outside this instance is publishing the value too.
 *
 * Feed presence is corroboration from a source that never saw the
 * instance's own events, which is why it belongs in the ledger at all.
 * It is also the signal most easily double-counted: a feed that mirrors
 * the same OSINT the instance already ingested is not an independent
 * voice — three mirrors of one OSINT source are one piece of
 * corroboration, not three.
 *
 * That dedupe is the `feeds.mirrored` exclusion's job, and
 * this signal reads whatever survives it. What it owns is the cap: two
 * feeds is corroboration, twelve feeds is a popular blocklist entry,
 * and the difference between those two is not five times as much
 * evidence.
 *
 * Absence fires as `no_feed`, weakly. A value nobody else publishes is
 * mildly thinner than one several do, and the row keeps the reader from
 * wondering whether the feeds were checked.
