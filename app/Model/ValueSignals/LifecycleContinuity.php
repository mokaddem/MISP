/**
 * Whether the reporting is continuous or a single burst.
 *
 * The flux value's +12 row — *"fourteen months without a month of
 * silence"* — and a genuinely different reading from *how much* and
 * *how recently*. A hundred reports inside one week and a hundred
 * spread evenly over two years are the same volume and not the same
 * kind of evidence: the second is infrastructure somebody keeps
 * finding, the first is one incident reported many times.
 *
 * **The longest unbroken run of months, not the span.** A value
 * reported in 2023 and again last week has a two-year span and no
 * continuity at all; counting the run is what makes the row's own
 * sentence true.
 *
 * **Aggregate evidence, so never windowed** (§2.3). The months come
 * from a grouped count over occurrence timestamps, which is cheap at
 * any cardinality — and a 90-day window would cap every long-lived
 * value at three months of continuity, turning the signal's own
 * subject into an artefact of the budget.
 *
 * Silent below `min_months`: two consecutive months is not a pattern,
 * and a row claiming one would be the engine over-reading its data.
