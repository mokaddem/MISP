/**
 * How much of the reporting was actually published.
 *
 * A draft event is a claim its own organisation has not yet stood
 * behind, so the same evidence in a published event is worth more.
 *
 * **Scaled rather than banded**, because the ratio is the evidence: a
 * value published in five of seven events is not in the same position
 * as one published in one of seven, and two thresholds would flatten
 * that into three cases. `scale` is what full publication is worth and
 * the contribution is the ratio of it.
 *
 * **No floor (D67).** At the shipped scale the ratio rounds to zero
 * only below one published event in eighteen, which no value on the
 * dev instance reaches (2026-10-01); a value with one published event
 * among many drafts reads `0`, between *none published* and the rest.
