/**
 * What this value has been attributed to.
 *
 * A galaxy cluster on an occurrence is a person's judgement that this
 * indicator belongs to a named actor, family or campaign — the
 * strongest editorial statement MISP's data model carries — so it is
 * worth more than another count of the same rows.
 *
 * **Absence fires here, and this is the case absence keys exist for.**
 * *"No galaxy and no technique on any occurrence"* scores toward
 * benign: nine occurrences, four organisations, and nobody willing to
 * attribute it to anything is evidence rather than a gap. It fires
 * only where the profile carries an `absent` key and only on genuine
 * absence — a cluster set an exclusion emptied leaves the row silent.
 *
 * **An absence says where it looked.** *Occurrence* is the whole of
 * the distinction this signal rests on, and a row that leans on the
 * word silently reads as a contradiction of the context card: the
 * Overview heads a *Threat Actor* group with *APT29*, this says nobody
 * attributed the value, and a reader is left to reconcile two true
 * sentences. So where the carrying events name a threat the count is
 * put in the row and the reason under it. **Nothing about the score
 * changes** — the event labels are not an attribution of the value and
 * are not paid for, which is the point the wording makes out loud
 * rather than by omission.
 *
 * **One point per cluster, not per occurrence.** The same actor tag on
 * a hundred occurrences is one attribution repeated; on *"QakBot, on
 * 107 occurrences"* a per-occurrence weight would pay 107 times for
 * one judgement. The occurrence count belongs in the prose,
 * where it is context rather than arithmetic.
 *
 * **Not every cluster is an attribution, and the profile says which
 * are.** The context splits a value's galaxy tags into techniques and
 * clusters on *is this ATT&CK-shaped*, so `clusters` is every galaxy
 * that is not — sectors, countries, countermeasures and typologies
 * included. Unfiltered, a value tagged `sector:banking`, `country:lu`
 * and a `preventive-measure` would be paid three times over and called
 * attribution. `galaxies.attribution` is the eligibility filter; a
 * profile declaring none counts every cluster, which is what a profile
 * written before the section existed needs.
 *
 * **The event's attribution reaches a flagged occurrence, at a
 * discount (D65).** Nearly every reporter attributes on the event
 * rather than on each attribute, so the clusters on an event in which
 * the reporter flagged this value `to_ids = 1` pay on a second row at
 * `per_event_cluster`, capped by `event_cap`. Flagged is what keeps
 * the caution above: it says this value is an indicator of the
 * report's threat, which the resolver an APT29 sample touched is not.
 * A cluster already on an occurrence is paid there and not again.
