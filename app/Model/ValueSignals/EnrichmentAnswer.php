/**
 * What outside sources said about this value, and how far the profile
 * believes them.
 *
 * The first signal that scores something MISP did not record itself.
 * Every other one reads MISP's own tables — who filed it, how often,
 * how long ago, what they tagged it — and the number that comes out is
 * a statement about the record. This one reads the enrichment store:
 * an opinion a third party gave when somebody pressed Run.
 *
 * ## It reads the store and never queries
 *
 * A signal that fired an HTTP request during scoring would be a signal
 * whose value depends on a third party's uptime, and a score that
 * moved because a vendor was slow is not reproducible. Firing is the
 * page's job and happens outside the engine; what arrives here is the
 * shaped answers already held, so the number is a pure function of
 * what the store contains. The clock affects when the page settles,
 * never what it says.
 *
 * ## One row per module
 *
 * *GreyNoise · malicious · asked 3 h ago · +12* — and the reader can
 * open the run behind that row and see the answer that produced it,
 * which is the ledger's existing invariant applied to a new source.
 * One row summing three vendors would be a number nobody could check.
 *
 * ## Only verdict-bearing shapes score
 *
 * A trust grade says how far to believe a source. It does not say what
 * the answer means — and the engine's whole contract is that a signal
 * declares points *toward or away from threat*. A geolocation, an
 * autonomous system, a certificate or a registration record has no
 * such reading: where an address sits is context. It is drawn in the
 * strip and never scored.
 *
 * Three shapes carry a verdict, and **the reading lives in their
 * renderers rather than here**: `ReputationRenderer::readingOf()` and
 * `FileVerdictRenderer::readingOf()` decide what `malicious`, `riot`
 * and `0/3` mean, and the widget on the Overview asks the same two
 * functions. Written again in this file it would be two readings of
 * one answer, which is how a widget and a ledger row start disagreeing
 * about the same thing.
 *
 * ## Ungraded is zero, and the row says so
 *
 * The shipped default grades no module, so on a stock instance these
 * rows appear in the ledger **marked as not counted**, with the reason.
 * The reader sees what outside sources said, sees that it moved
 * nothing, and grading a module in their profile is the single act
 * that turns it on. A shipped fallback grade would have the neutral
 * document asserting that some particular vendor is worth twelve
 * points.
 *
 * ## Two windows, two jobs
 *
 * The store's own reuse window decides when a run is stale enough to
 * ask *again*; this signal's `window_hours` decides when a stored
 * answer stops *counting*. They are different questions and a profile
 * sets them separately: a fraud analyst and a disinformation
 * researcher disagree about how long an answer stays true, and neither
 * disagrees per vendor. A row past the window stays in the ledger,
 * not counted, with its age — the reader sees that somebody asked and
 * that the answer has expired, and a press refreshes it.
 *
 * ## An empty answer is not an opinion
 *
 * A module that ran and found nothing produces no row. Absence of an
 * outside opinion is what the eleven shipped signals already measure
 * from MISP's own tables; counting it again here would pay twice for
 * one silence.
