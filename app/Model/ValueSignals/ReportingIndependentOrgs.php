/**
 * How many organisations independently hold an occurrence of this value.
 *
 * The heaviest row in the fixture's malicious ledger (+28 from four
 * organisations) and the page's own argument for what corroboration
 * means: an organisation is one voice however many events it puts the
 * value in, which is the same independence rule the lean derivation
 * applies to `to_ids` stances (`04-dispositions.md` §3).
 *
 * **Aggregate evidence, so never windowed** (§2.3). A `COUNT DISTINCT`
 * over the orgs holding an occurrence is cheap at any cardinality, and
 * bounding it to 90 days would make a long-lived value look narrowly
 * reported for no reason but its age.
 *
 * One organisation still fires. *"1 organisation reported it"* is the
 * median value's own row, and it is worth `per_org` rather than
 * nothing — what makes the median record thin is the rest of the
 * ledger, not a signal refusing to speak (§7.4).
 *
 * **Trust-weighted** (`07-reference.md` §2.4), and the heaviest row on
 * the page is the reason: the count of organisations becomes a *sum of
 * their grades*, so four organisations graded `B/B/C/D` contribute
 * `7 × (1.10 + 1.10 + 1.00 + 0.75)` rather than `7 × 4`. Capped after
 * the weighting and rounded once, at the end. With no grade in force
 * every factor is `1.0` and the sum is the count, to the unit.
