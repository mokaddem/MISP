/**
 * The Value Profile page's per-panel facade.
 *
 * One public method per panel, each returning the array shape that
 * panel's template already reads. `useTable = false`: this model owns no
 * data of its own, it assembles other models' answers into a panel.
 *
 * **Why this is per panel and not per page.**
 * `ValuesController::profileFor()` builds every tab's data and hands the
 * whole array to whichever endpoint asked for it. With a fixture that is
 * one array literal and costs nothing. Live it would be nine tabs of
 * queries per panel request and twenty-odd panel requests per tab visit,
 * so the whole-profile shape does not survive going live — see
 * prd/value-profile-live/00-contract.md §14.1.
 *
 * **Why this is not one big `Value` model.** §4 of the page's PRD
 * refused to build this feature inside `AttributesController` because
 * ~3,800 lines across 40+ actions is not somewhere to add a feature. A
 * single model carrying nine tabs of panel assembly reaches the same
 * size by the same route. `Value` owns the value's identity and its
 * ACL'd occurrence set and is deliberately kept small; this owns
 * assembly and knows what a panel looks like.
 *
 * **What it must not do**, per §14.2: issue its own SQL against
 * attribute value storage. `Value` is the only file in this feature that
 * knows how a value resolves to rows.

     * A cap on the *result size*, not on the query count — the six

     * occurrences. On a real instance a value like `443` resolves to
     * tens of thousands of occurrences as the port half of

     *
     * **300.** Two things bound it, and neither is the query — nothing
     * here scales with occurrence count.
     *
     * The page control renders one button per page inline, so the button
     * count is rows ÷ page size and it shares the panel header with the
     * subtitle. Measured at a 1500px viewport: twelve buttons leave the
     * subtitle readable on two lines, twenty squeeze it to a 16px column,
     * twenty-five push the panel into horizontal overflow. At the default
     * page size of 60 this cap is five pages, which is seven buttons; at
     * the smallest the reader can pick, 25, it is twelve.
     *
     * The other bound is the fragment. A row costs roughly 5.7 KB of
     * markup, so 300 rows is about 1.7 MB — against the 5.9 MB that
     * 1,000 rows of `443` produced when this was first written, which is
     * a fragment that does not arrive. Raising it further is now a
     * question about weight rather than about the pager, which is the
     * more honest place for the limit to sit.
     *
     * When the cap bites, the panel says so — §14.6 keeps cap notices,
     * because a cap is not a permission.

     * different numbers for one value. On `8.8.8.8` the badges read 9
     * and 17 against 23 occurrences and 53 reports.
     *
     * **Phase 29 ran, and this survived it rather than being folded
     * in.** `forFrame` calls it, so the frame is still one read from
     * the controller's side; what it keeps is the argument below for
     * which badges can be told truly, which is a ruling about the tab
     * bar rather than about the fixture that used to fill it.
     *
     * **Occurrences gets a real number.** One `COUNT`, and pointedly
     * the same call `forOccurrenceTable` makes for the total its own
     * header prints — not another aggregate that ought to agree with
     * it. Two counts that should match are two counts that can drift;
     * one call cannot disagree with itself.
     *
     * **Sightings had no number at all, and now has one.** The badge
     * was removed rather than zeroed because a sighting count has to be
     * the viewer's — `Sightings_policy` hides whole reports and two
     * readers would otherwise read two numbers off one tab bar — and
     * getting the viewer's count meant running the policy over fetched
     * rows, the panel's own 13 queries, on every page load of a tab
     * most readers never open. That note asked for *"`Sighting`
     * growing a counting method that applies the policy in SQL instead
     * of in PHP over fetched rows"*, and phase 29 built it:
     * `Sighting::visibilityConditions` is the policy as a predicate and
     * `Value::sightingCountsFor` is one indexed aggregate over it.
     *
     * **The caller passes it in rather than this method fetching it**,
     * because the fact strip needs the same number and the two must not
     * be two counts. `forFrame` makes the one call and hands the total
     * here — which is the rule the occurrence count below states the
     * other way round, and the reason both badges can be trusted.
     * Timeline and History still carry no badge.
     *
     * **Relationships gets a number that names its own unit.** The
     * fixture's badge was the *correlation* total, and nothing on the
     * live tab computes one: co-occurrence there is an event join
     * rather than correlation output (`24-relationships.md` §3), so the
     * old number was not merely stale, it counted something the tab no
     * longer claims. The join's own total — `distinct_values` — is
     * still refused here for the sightings reason: it needs the panel's
     * whole scan, up to 20,000 attribute rows and about a second on the
     * heaviest value on the instance, on every page load.
     *
     * What is affordable is the notion the tab was re-founded on
     * (`24-relationships.md` §26). **How many objects this value sits
     * in** is one indexed aggregate — 0.3 ms on `8.8.8.8`, 84 ms on
     * `0.0.0.0` — and it is the same number the sibling panel's census
     * and the graph's object layer already print, because
     * `Value::objectCountFor` carries the conditions of the call that
     * fetches those rows.
     *
     * **It rides the badge pill, not the parenthesised count**, and the
     * distinction is the whole of why this one can be told. `(15)` on a
     * tab called Relationships reads as *fifteen relationships*, which
     * is the claim that got the correlation badge removed; the pill
     * takes a label, so the unit travels with the number. The tab bar
     * inherits the contents strip's rule that seven notions have seven
     * units and none of them is a total.
     *
     * **Zero shows nothing at all**, which is what keeps this honest
     * rather than merely cheap. A value can sit in no object and still
     * have an analyst claim, a near-match or a remote hit — near-matches
     * alone cannot be priced at page-load cost — so a badge reading
     * *0 objects* would answer *is this tab worth opening* wrongly, in
     * the one direction that costs a reader something. An absent pill
     * therefore keeps the meaning it has today, *no number can be told
     * truly*, and adding a probe can only turn silence into a true
     * badge, never into a false one.
     *
     * **The warm-digest peek was the other candidate, and is refused.**
     * `relationDigest` is held in Redis per user and value, so a `GET`
     * here would hand over the exact join total for free once the tab
     * had been opened — `24-relationships.md` §15.1 item 1 built that
     * context. But a badge that appears only after the visit it exists
     * to inform has missed its one job, and an intermittent number
     * conflates *not read yet* with *nothing there*, which is the
     * conflation the contents strip's placeholder was built to prevent.

    /**
     * How this instance spells the value the reader typed, if it holds
     * it at all — and the one neighbour worth offering if it does not.
     *
     * The resolver's whole read (`value-index.md` §7.1). It answers the
     * question the paste box asks — *is this here?* — and nothing else:
     * no assessment, no counts, no types. A hit sends the reader to the
     * profile, which is the page that says everything else, and a miss
     * is an answer rather than an error.
     *
     * **It answers with the stored spelling, not the reader's.** The
     * value columns are `utf8mb3_unicode_ci` and MISP lowercases every
     * hash, domain, hostname and email address on the way in, so
     * `CiRcL.lu` matches nine rows that all say `circl.lu` — and
     * `/values/view` renders the string in its URL. Sending the
     * reader's own spelling through would title a page with a value
     * nobody holds, over the occurrences, orgs and types of one
     * everybody does. `Value::spellingsFor` therefore answers both
     * halves in one statement: what is recorded, and how.
     *
     * **One bounded statement, and it is not an aggregate.** An
     * existence test wants to stop at the first row:
     * `occurrenceCountFor` reads all 48,255 occurrences of `443` to
     * say *yes*, where this reads four. It is an equality on the
     * indexed `value1` and `value2`, scoped by the same
     * `buildConditions` the profile uses — so **a value the reader may
     * not see is absent here exactly as a value nobody recorded is**
     * (§4.2, and `value-index.md` §8 G3).
     *
     * **The case probe runs on the miss path only**, and on a
     * conformant instance it can only miss, because a spelling it
     * would find has already been found by the exact match. It is for
     * an instance whose value columns were created under MISP's
     * `utf8mb3_bin` table default — drift that `schemaDiagnostics`
     * reports — where `Google.com` and `google.com` really are two
     * values. What it asks is `caseVariants`: the two or three
     * spellings a paste arrives in, each an indexed equality, in one
     * further statement. A fold would be correct on both collations
     * and is refused: `LOWER()` on the stored column discards the
     * 255-character prefix index over 3.9M rows. A value with no cased
     * letters, `8.8.8.8` among them, issues no second statement.
     *
     * What comes back from that probe is an offer and never a
     * redirect: only the reader knows which spelling the report meant.

     * machinery to keep. What a row shows about a value is the
     * assessment or nothing.

     * one statement for the list.** The array-shaped read is the
     * obvious shape and it is wrong, measured rather than reasoned:

     * `index_merge sort_union`, which collects row ids for **every**
     * occurrence of every value before any `LIMIT` applies, and the
     * limit then takes a prefix of them in row-id order. A paste
     * carrying one hot value spends that prefix on it — on the
     * verification instance, a hundred values including `flood`
     * (65,717 occurrences) answered **75 of 99** at four rows a value,
     * and answering all of them meant reading 357 rows in 1,288 ms.
     * The same list as bounded per-value equalities answered 99 of 99
     * in 120 ms. The per-value shape also costs what the *list* is
     * long rather than what its most popular value is popular, which
     * is the property a page with a hundred-value cap needs.
     *
     * **A value with no cased letters is not asked about at all.** It
     * has one possible spelling — `caseVariants` empty is that test,
     * and it is the same one that saves the resolver its second
     * statement — so an IP, a port or a timestamp costs nothing here.
     * An IOC list is rarely all hashes: the two pastes measured above
     * asked 64 and 59 statements for their hundred values.
     *
     * **The collapse happens after the read, not before.** Two
     * spellings of one value are two values to `ValueInputTool`, which

     * An assessment is not a property of a value: it is what a set of

     * org → instance default with the nearest owner winning. A reader
     * who does not know which of the three answered has no way to read
     * a band they disagree with, so the strip at the head of
     * `/values/index` says it before the box does anything
     * (`value-index.md` §7.5).
     *
     * **The scope is the half that can be acted on.** Under D3 the
     * name says which document and the scope says whose — whether
     * disagreeing with a weight means editing your own page's
     * thresholds, your colleagues' too, or the instance's.
     *
     * **`revision` tells a changed assessment from a changed value.**
     * It is the local edit counter `AnalystProfile::bumpRevision()`
     * moves, and the same number the profile's own page cites, so a
     * reader whose band moved overnight can tell which of the two
     * things under it moved.
     *
     * **`editable` is the editor's own predicate**, not a restatement
     * of it. `AnalystProfilesController::edit()` refuses with
     * `isEditableByCurrentUser()`, and a strip that decided
     * separately — by scope, say — would offer a site admin no link to
     * the default they may edit, and offer an ordinary reader on their
     * organisation's profile one that 403s. An edit link that 403s is
     * worse than no edit link (§7.5), and the only way to be sure it
     * does not is to ask the same question the action asks.
     *
     * **No profile in force is a real state.** `resolveFor()` returns
     * null when a site admin has disabled the default and the reader
     * owns nothing, and every assessment on the instance then carries
     * a lean and no quality — `ValueVerdictTool::qualityBand()` bands
     * `none` when no signal can fire. That is worth a sentence, which
     * is the caller's to write; this returns null and says so.
     *
     * **It costs nothing on a page that assessed anything.**

     * declares, and what the enrichment store already holds.

     *
     * **What is not here, and why.** Nothing counts values or
     * attributes. `Value::$useTable` is false because the subject of
     * this feature is a string rather than a row, so an *instance
     * holds N values* tile is a `GROUP BY value1` over 3.9M rows that
     * no `LIMIT` bounds (§1.1). The cheap approximation is worse than
     * nothing rather than merely imprecise: `tableRows()` answered
     * 3,034,901 against a measured 3,915,429 on the development
     * instance — 23% low — and the honest `COUNT(*)` took 285 ms,
     * which is the whole page's budget spent on a figure nobody asked
     * for. Nothing here reports activity either: what an organisation
     * recently enriched or sighted is what it is currently
     * investigating, which is the disclosure D27 refuses.
     *
     * **Three of the tiles describe a profile, so they are null when
     * none is in force.** A site admin can disable the default, and a
     * *0 signals* tile beside a strip already saying assessments carry
     * no quality is a second, worse way of saying the same thing. The

     *      48,255 occurrences
     *   2. `typesFor` — the banner's type chips, and the strip's
     *      *n types* sub-line for free

     *   4. `sightingCountsFor` — the strip's sightings cell **and** the
     *      Sightings tab's badge, which is one call rather than two
     *      because a badge and a cell reading one quantity twice is how
     *      they come to disagree
     *   5. `value2CountFor` — the note below the banner
     *   6, 7. `forTabCounts` — the occurrence and object badges
     *
     * The eighth read on a page load is the assessment behind the tab
     * pill, at 9 to 27, and it is not this method's: `ValuesController::
     * view()` asks for it separately because it is the one thing here
     * that can be told only by running the engine.
     *
     * **The warninglist chip takes the names and not the categories.**
     * The Lifecycle card resolves categories through the analyst's
     * override map, which costs the profile; the chip says only *this
     * value is on a list*, which the hits alone answer. Both call

     * tab's *Who says what* — same read, same `to_ids` stance word, one
     * fewer column set — and the month strip is the Timeline tab's
     * *Activity on this value* with the axis the data's own extent
     * rather than a brushed twelve-month window. A reader who opens
     * either tab must find the same numbers there, which is why this
     * reads the same two methods rather than counting rows.
     *
     * **Three queries, and three on every value** — the stance
     * aggregate, the organisation names behind it, and the month
     * aggregate — because both reads are grouped over the value's own
     * indexed rows rather than over its occurrences. 347 ms on `443`,
     * the instance's heaviest value at 48,255 occurrences, against the
     * 223 ms `forOccurrences` pays beside it; 2 ms on a value with one
     * occurrence. Its own endpoint rather than folded into that one, on
     * the tab's standing rule — one endpoint per panel, so a slow read
     * never holds up the card next to it.
     *
     * **`orgStanceFor` excludes soft-deleted rows and the fact strip's
     * total does not**, so the two are not the same number and this
     * does not print the strip's. The split's denominator is the sum of
     * its own rows, which is what the bar actually divides; saying
     * *N of 26* against a strip reading 26 would claim the split
     * accounts for rows it left out.
     *
     * **A month with no occurrence is drawn rather than skipped.** The
     * gaps are the reading — `lifecycle.continuity` scores exactly this
     * and the Assessment tab prints *4 months without a month of
     * silence* off it — so the span is filled in here rather than left
     * to the template to infer from the keys it was handed.

     * The Overview's context card: what the community has labelled this
     * value.
     *
     * Four reads and a cap:
     *
     *   1. `topTagsFor` — the labels on its occurrences, most-carried
     *      first, bounded
     *   2. `eventTagsFor` — the labels on the events it appears in,
     *      the same way, and folded into the first
     *   3. `getTagConflicts` — MISP's own exclusivity ruling
     *   4. `fetchGalaxyClusters` — which clusters this viewer may know
     *      exist
     *
     * **It was five reads and unbounded, and `443` is why it is not.**
     * The first build scoped the tags through `occurrenceEventsFor`,
     * read them with `ownTagsFor` and resolved every carrying event's
     * organisation with `fetchSimpleEvents`, so that each tag could
     * name who applied it. On `443` that is 1,844 events and **3,860
     * distinct tags**, and the card rendered all of them: a **2.9 MB**
     * fragment for a panel whose heading is a summary. The per-tag
     * organisations went with the rework, and they are the part worth
     * missing least — neither `attribute_tags` nor `event_tags` records
     * who applied a tag, so that list was never *who said this*, only
     * *whose events carry it*, which is a weaker claim than the
     * tooltip was making.
     *
     * **What the cap costs is stated rather than hidden.** The card
     * draws the most-carried `CONTEXT_TAG_CAP` labels and says so when
     * there are more, and no scale is drawn on a capped read at all —
     * a position means *one tag of this dimension*, and a truncated
     * list cannot tell that from *one that was read*.
     *
     * **The conflict marker is MISP's and not this page's.**
     * `Taxonomy::getTagConflicts` reads `exclusive` off the taxonomy
     * and the predicate, and it knows that `tlp:white` and `tlp:clear`
     * are one colour under two spellings. A rule invented here would
     * have marked every instance still carrying both as contradicting
     * itself.
     *
     * **Galaxy tags are not galaxy names.** The reader returns them
     * with `is_galaxy` set and `ownTagsFor` says in its own docblock
     * that naming the cluster needs `fetchGalaxyClusters` to rule
     * first — the ruling is the caller's either way. A tag whose
     * cluster does not come back is absent from the card, uncounted and
     * unmentioned.

         * clusters survived depended on how crowded the plain list was
         * — and the live probe caught the consequence: a CIRCL org
         * admin, seeing 45 of the value's 1,844 events, was shown *more*
         * clusters than a site admin who can see all of them. Neither

         * ----------------------------------------------------------
         * **Two scopes, one list.**
         * ----------------------------------------------------------
         * Each kind is read at both scopes and the results are folded
         * together before anything is grouped. The card drew them as
         * two sections for one day, and the reason it no longer does is
         * the one that governs the rest of the page: an attribute is
         * covered by its event's labelling, so *tagged on the report*
         * and *tagged on the indicator* are the same statement about
         * this value made at two removes, not two findings. And an
         * attribute carrying a tag of its own is the rare case — most
         * do not — so the split spent a heading, a glyph and half the
         * card's height separating a long list from a usually empty
         * one.
         *
         * **What the fold costs is the `×N` beside each chip**, and it
         * is the honest price. `topTagsFor` counts the occurrences
         * carrying a tag and `eventTagsFor` counts the events carrying
         * it; the same tag answers 2 and 8 on `8.8.8.8`. Their union is
         * not a number either read holds — an occurrence tagged
         * `tlp:white` inside an event tagged `tlp:white` is one thing
         * counted on both sides — and buying it costs a second pass
         * over the value's `attribute_tags`, 450ms on `443` for a
         * number in small print. So `mergeTagScopes` keeps both counts
         * exactly as they were read, sorts on the larger, and the card
         * states each one in the chip's title where it can name its own
         * unit. Every remaining `×N` on this page still counts one
         * thing.
         *
         * **It does not move the Assessment.** `reporting.attribution`
         * scores *no galaxy on any occurrence* and still means exactly
         * that; a cluster on the event is a weaker claim about the
         * value and is not evidence the engine was asked for. A reader
         * seeing clusters here and *no galaxy on any occurrence* in the
         * rail is reading two sentences about different things.
         *
         * Each read asks for one row more than the list will draw, so
         * *there are more* is answered by the fetch rather than by a
         * second aggregate.

     * recomputed. The other two are this phase's.
     *
     * **The warninglist line reads the Assessment tab's own resolver.**
     * `verdictWarninglist` resolves each hit's category through the

     * surfaces on one page resolving one hit's category independently
     * is how they come to disagree, and this page has been bitten by
     * that three times.
     *
     * **The correlation line is a flag and no longer a count.** It
     * printed *n correlations* off the fixture. Nothing live can
     * produce that number honestly: correlations attach to attributes
     * rather than to values, so a value's total is a union over its

     * its correlations mean nothing — and it draws only when set: *0
     * correlations* would be false rather than merely unhelpful, since

     * A galaxy tag reaches the row on either scope — its own
     * `AttributeTag` or its event's `EventTag` — and until now every
     * surface in the occurrences pane **dropped** it. That was
     * `Fields/tag_list`'s rule inherited without being re-argued: a
     * cluster is not a label, and the Overview's context card draws it
     * as a cluster. What the rule missed is that the context card is
     * *the value's* attribution, and the table's question is which
     * occurrences — on `8.8.8.8`, 9 of 26 rows carry a cluster and 26
     * distinct ones are on the page, none of them reachable from the
     * tab a reader is looking at.
     *
     * **A galaxy tag is not a cluster until `fetchGalaxyClusters` says
     * so**, which is the same ruling `ValueProfile::galaxyClusters`
     * makes for the card and for the same two reasons: the tag carries
     * no readable name, and seeing a row is not permission to know what
     * its cluster is. `1.162.239.42` carries four galaxy tags of which
     * **two** come back. A tag with no cluster row is absent, with
     * nothing drawn in its place and no count of what was withheld.
     *
     * **One query for the page**, as everything else that attaches here
     * does: the rows are capped at `OCCURRENCE_CAP`, so their distinct
     * galaxy tags are bounded by it — 26 on the widest value the
     * instance has, resolved in 11ms.
     *
     * Each row's clusters are deduplicated by tag name, so a cluster on
     * the attribute *and* on its event is one entry. They carry their
     * galaxy, because the column groups by it and the rail names it.

     *                        the same reader gets one click away.
     *   lookup_visible = 0   site admin. The column defaults to 0, so on
     *                        a stock instance this is every feed.
     *   sync servers         site admin only. One notch stricter than
     *                        the event view, which admits the host org,
     *                        because `servers/previewEvent` is site
     *                        admin only and the link is the row's whole
     *                        value.
     *
     * **The feed rule read `perm_view_feed_correlations` until B3, and
     * that was a disclosure.** All three surfaces MISP ships withhold a
     * non-lookup-visible feed's *identity* from everyone but a site
     * admin: `Feed::getCachedFeedsOrServers` conditions on
     * `lookup_visible = 1` for `!perm_site_admin`, and `/feeds/index`
     * and `/feeds/searchCaches` add a host-org branch that cannot fire
     * — they compare a session `org_id` (string `'1'`) against
     * `MISP.host_org_id` (int `1`) with `!==`, so every non-site-admin
     * takes the limited path. `perm_view_feed_correlations` gates
     * *whether feed correlations are shown at all*, never *which feeds
     * may be named*, and `AppModel`'s own migration sets it to 1 for
     * every existing role — so on any upgraded instance the old rule
     * handed each of them the name, URL and remote events of feeds
     * `/feeds/index` refuses to list for them. Measured on the dev
     * instance 2026-09-01: a non-host-org Org Admin carrying the perm
     * was handed `CIRCL OSINT Feed`, its URL and two event links for a
     * value, while `searchCaches` returned that reader one feed and
     * `/feeds/index` did not list it at all.
     *
     * The host-org branch is deliberately not reproduced here. Copying
     * it would mean copying a comparison that does not do what it reads
     * as doing, and fixing it belongs to those surfaces, not to a page
     * that only reads them.
     *
     * `Feed::searchCaches` applies no role check at all, so nothing here
     * may render its output directly. It is called for the whole
     * instance and its hits are then intersected with the ids this
     * reader is allowed to be told about.
     *
     * **`restricted` is keyed on the role and never on the value.** It
     * is true whenever the instance holds cached sources of that kind
     * that this reader's role cannot reach, whether or not this
     * particular value hits any of them — which is what lets it exist
     * at all under `live/00-contract.md` §14.6. A notice that appeared

    /**
     * The named threats reachable through this value, as a slice of the
     * co-occurrence fold.
     *
     * **A named threat is a galaxy cluster and nothing else**, and
     * `GalaxyCategory` holds both that rule and the evidence for it.
     * The short version: freetext tags cannot carry the claim — the two
     * most-used on this instance are the word `malware` and ` C2`, and
     * one malware family appears under seven spellings — and no
     * installed taxonomy names an individual threat, they classify one.
     *
     * **This used to be six queries and is now one.** §10.2's change of
     * definition is what made that possible: a galaxy cluster is a
     * neighbour in its own right now, so the events, their metadata,
     * their tags, the tags on this value's own occurrences and the
     * `fetchGalaxyClusters` ruling over all of them are read once by
     * `readRelationScan` and folded once by `ValueRelationTool`. This
     * card reads that fold, filters it to `named-threat`, and ranks
     * what is left for a 340px rail.
     *
     * The one query left is the one the fold cannot answer: a claim
     * points at a cluster by UUID and may name one that appears on no
     * event here, so `claimClusters` still resolves those under the
     * viewer's ACL. It sends nothing when no claim names a cluster.
     *
     * **The scope property that had to survive.** The card answers on
     * values whose neighbourhood table is suppressed entirely, because
     * an event's tags cost the same whatever its size while its
     * attributes do not. That is why `readRelationScan` reads the label
     * side over every event the value is in rather than over the events
     * the attribute budget afforded — the note is there too, and the
     * two have to stay in step.
     *
     * **What `orgs` counts, and what it cannot.** Neither `event_tags`
     * nor `attribute_tags` records who applied a tag — there is no org
     * and no user on either table — so this counts the *creator
     * organisations of the events carrying the cluster*, and the card
     * says so in words. A claim is the one source that does record an
     * author, and contributes that org instead.
     *
     * **Four ways in, one word out.** A cluster can arrive on the
     * value's own occurrence, on a neighbouring attribute, on an event
     * the value appears in, or as the far end of an analyst's claim
     * about it. Where more than one applies the most specific wins,
     * which is the order in `threatRank` — and it is a decision rather
     * than a derivation: a claim outranks a tag on the value because it
     * carries an author and a relationship type, so it is the more
     * informative thing to print. The first three are the fold's own
     * `attachment`, decided in `ValueRelationTool::$attachments` so
     * that the word on this row and the word on the table's row are
     * the same word from the same place.
     *
     * **A fifth is coming.** Objects cannot be tagged yet: the join
     * tables are `attribute_tags`, `event_tags` and
     * `event_report_tags`, there is no `object_tags`, and `MispObject`
     * reaches a tag only through its attributes. When `ObjectTag`
     * lands, a cluster on the object a value sits in belongs between
     * `value` and `neighbour` in both rank tables — grep either name to
     * find them.

     * `initial-access`, so that galaxy alone cannot say which of them
     * comes first. It matters: `attack-PRE`'s two tactics reach 36
     * events on the verification instance, and a strip putting
     * reconnaissance after impact reads as a bug. Two galaxies ship the
     * whole chain as a single list — `cmtmf-attack-pattern` states
     * ATT&CK's fourteen tactics in order and `mitre-atlas-attack-
     * pattern` states them with its two ML stages inserted — and
     * reading those alongside the platform tabs supplies exactly the
     * relation the tabs omit. So the answer stays derived from shipped
     * data instead of from a tactic list hardcoded here, which is the
     * whole reason `GalaxyCategory` exists.
     *
     * **A single-list galaxy is read before a multi-tab one**, longest
     * list first, because one list is an unambiguous statement about
     * the whole chain while many tabs state an order per platform and
     * nothing between the platforms. Read the other way round, the
     * platform tabs place `initial-access` first and the complete chain
     * then contradicts them.
     *
     * **The merge inserts and never moves.** Each list walks the chain
     * built so far, and a tactic it names that is already placed only
     * advances the insertion point — so where two frameworks genuinely
     * disagree the first one read wins, deterministically, rather than
     * the merge having to detect a cycle and pick a loser anyway. A
     * list sharing no tactic with the chain is a separate framework's
     * kill chain — `attck4fraud`'s seven, the deprecated `pre-attack`'s
     * seventeen — and follows the chain rather than being interleaved
     * into it.
     *
     * **A new tactic lands as late as its list allows**, immediately
     * before the next tactic that list names and the chain has already
     * placed, rather than immediately after the previous one. Both
     * satisfy the list; the late reading puts a tactic beside the ones
     * it belongs with. MoTIF's `defence-evasion` is the case that shows
     * it: its list says only *after persistence, before credential
     * access*, and inserting early left the British spelling sitting
     * two places ahead of ATT&CK's `defense-evasion` instead of next
     * to it, which reads as a sort fault rather than as two frameworks

     * moment it is shown, so on the first visit to Relationships the
     * co-occurrence and dated panels ask for the scan while the graph,
     * threat and settings panels ask for the digest that contains it.
     * A plain `GET`/`SETEX` pair means all five miss together and all
     * five scan, so the reader pays for one scan five times over and
     * the five copies contend for the same rows while they do it.
     *
     * Measured on `8.8.8.8` before this: the nine panels cold took
     * **15.1 s** wall-clock, against **5.4 s** for the same nine when a
     * single scan had been primed first — worse than *sequential*,
     * whose slowest panel was 6.2 s. The duplication was not merely
     * wasted, it was the largest single cost on the tab.
     *
     * So the first request through takes a lock and computes; the rest
     * wait on the key it will write. A waiter that finds the lock gone
     * with nothing written computes rather than reporting an error —
     * the leader died, and a slow answer beats none. Losing Redis

     * The neighbourhood as a real node/edge feed, re-founded on the
     * object rather than on the event.
     *
     * **What this replaced and why** (`03-relationships.md` §23). The
     * first version of this feed drew one edge per value sharing an
     * *event* with this one. That is a star, it carries nothing the
     * three panels beneath it do not already print, and on live data it
     * drew 36 of `8.8.8.8`'s 10,024 neighbours. §24 of
     * `24-relationships.md` measured the topology behind it: components
     * equal event count, no neighbour spans two, a bridge fires once in
     * sixteen values. Sharing a container is not a relation.
     *
     * Sharing an *object* is. A `passive-dns` object says *this name
     * resolved to this address between these dates*; a `domain-ip` says
     * *this domain is on this address*. `8.8.8.8` has 22
     * object-mediated neighbours against 10,024 event-mediated ones,
     * and 95.6 % of values that sit in objects have fifty or fewer.
     *
     * **Five layers, each with its own edge kind:**
     *
     *     object      shares an object with this value
     *     event       this value appears in this event
     *     near        CIDR containment, ssdeep proximity
     *     human       an analyst wrote this claim
     *     reference   MISP's own typed relation between two objects
     *
     * **The event layer draws events and stops.** An event node is the
     * event; it does not expand into the ten thousand attributes inside
     * it. That is what keeps the layer affordable and what makes it
     * worth having — *which events is this value in* is a real
     * question, and an event node answers it.
     *
     * **Nothing is truncated anywhere.** Above the legibility bound the
     * object layer collapses to one node per template carrying its
     * object count, and every other layer rolls its tail into a single
     * counted node rather than dropping it. No caption on this canvas
     * states a fraction of a whole the reader cannot reach, which is
     * the defect §22.1 identified.
     *
     * **Two feeds, because there are two surfaces.** `peek` is the
     * rail — rolled hard, one node per template, a single node for the
     * events — and `feed` is the overlay, which expands the object
     * layer into values where the bound allows. That is what gives
     * `Open the full graph` a specific meaning rather than making it a
     * second copy of the same picture.

     * rows before a single sighting is added. So the array is capped at
     * `TIMELINE_ROW_CAP` and the counts come from aggregates over the
     * whole scoped set beside it — two grains of one query rather than
     * two queries, and the panel states both numbers.
     *
     * The rejected alternative was to cap the entry set and let the

     * `fetchSimpleEvents` for every event the value sits in, never one
     * call per event.

     * **`window` is what makes the cap survivable.** Without it the
     * fragment is the newest `TIMELINE_ROW_CAP` entries and a reader
     * who brushes the spine past them has a chart with no chronology
     * under it. Measured at the 300 this shipped with: `8.8.8.8`'s
     * newest 300 began at 2025-11-16, so eleven of its 23 bars were
     * unreadable — and that finding is what raised the cap afterwards,
     * which is why the value no longer shows it. With the window the
     * panel can be asked again, and the same cap then means the newest
     * cap-many *of that window*: `193.161.193.99` still needs it at
     * 1,000, being 2,256 entries of which 1,256 land in the first two

     * - An `add` row in `audit_logs` over these occurrences, objects or

     *   is no later than every other trace of the value: the audit log
     *   has a start, and a record created before it began leaves the
     *   oldest `add` row describing some *later* arrival.
     * - Otherwise the oldest trace of any kind is a bound — the value
     *   was here by then. That is every dated entry the tab found *that
     *   the instance itself left*, and every occurrence's last-modified
     *   stamp, which is the older of the two on a record nobody has
     *   touched since.
     *
     * **A claim is not a trace**, and the second bullet is where that
     * distinction has to be enforced rather than merely stated. The
     * paragraph above rules `first_seen` out by name; an object's
     * `datetime` field is the same kind of fact and used to walk in
     * anyway, because the bound was read off the axis's left edge.
     * `8.8.8.8` is what that looks like: a `passive-dns` object dated
     * this instance to 2013-01-15, nine years before its oldest
     * occurrence. `TIMELINE_CLAIM_SOURCES` is the list, and
     * `timelineFirstRecord` applies it.

     * reaches its attributes, and the two drift apart from there.

     * the instance, and blind in the direction that matters — it drew
     * a value as undated when a date was one join away, in a table
     * this reader already joins for the ACL.
     *
     * Merging needs an aggregation rule nobody has agreed on, and this
     * lane invents none: each span stays its own row labelled with the
     * occurrence it came from, and the bound is a cap on how many are
     * drawn rather than a rule for combining them. A cap is not a
     * permission, so the lane says so for every reader.
     *
     * **Instants are instants.** 68,083 of the instance's dated
     * occurrences have `first_seen == last_seen`, against 109,320 real
     * spans and 2,475 open-ended ones. A zero-width bar says nothing, so

     * the proposal *last moved*, and the precision chip is the tab's
     * existing way of saying exactly that.
     *
     * **`deleted = 1` means resolved, and cannot say how.** Accepting a
     * proposal and discarding one both end at `setDeleted`
     * (`ShadowAttribute.php:510`, reached from the accept path at

     * writes `deleted = 1` **and stamps `timestamp` with the moment it
     * ran**. Two consequences the rows carry rather than smooth over:
     * a resolved proposal sits on the axis at its resolution and not at
     * its proposal, and no row may say *withdrawn*, because the schema
     * that would tell withdrawn from accepted does not exist.
     *
     * Epoch zero is excluded rather than plotted in 1970, as the
     * publications lane excludes it. `timestamp` is `NOT NULL
     * DEFAULT 0`, so the row is possible; none of this instance's 23 is
     * one, which makes it a branch written from the schema rather than
     * from an observation.

     * so under it every other reader gets an empty tab and no way to
     * tell that from a quiet value. `__createEventIndexConditions`
     * (`:488`) is the right subject and the wrong cost: it runs a full
     * `fetchEvent()` per event to enumerate the ids the viewer may see,
     * and then reads the events' whole audit history — 204
     * `fetchEvent()` calls over 816,041 rows on `193.161.193.99`, of
     * which 1,007 are about the value.
     *

     * the third line's column are measured rather than tidy** —
     * `auditScopeQueries` has why each is 10× to 100× the whole cost of
     * this reader on `443`.
     *
     * **Why this is safe and not merely cheap.** For any viewer and any
     * event this returns a *subset* of what
     * `__createEventIndexConditions` would hand them on that event's
     * own audit index: that model grants every `model = 'Event'` row
     * plus the rows for the attributes, objects, proposals and
     * references the viewer may see, and this asks for the same thing
     * narrowed to the occurrences of one value. The page discloses
     * nothing MISP does not already disclose on a page that ships. It
     * costs no `fetchEvent()` because the narrowing that model pays
     * `fetchEvent()` to compute is the narrowing `Value`'s accessors
     * have already done. The claim is a subset claim, which is why it
     * is falsifiable: a viewer class for whom this returns *more* than
     * that model would grant on the same event reopens the decision.
     *
     * **What it drops, and the tab says so.** Sibling rows — an edit to
     * another attribute in an event this value sits in is not this
     * value's history. `ShadowAttribute` and `ObjectReference` rows,
     * which that model includes for an event: proposals reach the
     * Timeline as their own dated lane and need no audit row, and
     * object references do not reach it. And nothing is scoped by
     * `model_title`: an occurrence edited *into* this value carries
     * rows describing what it was before, they are that occurrence's
     * rows and they are shown, and the row names the occurrence and the
     * action rather than the title. Scoping by title would be both
     * wrong — `model_title` prefers the new value — and a scan, since
     * it is an unindexed `text` column.
     *
     * The rows come from a plain read and the counts from an aggregate,
     * and both take the id set from `Value`, so permissions were settled

     * materialising `443`'s 162,539 rows to count them in PHP is the
     * wrong shape — a tally over the fetched page also stops being
     * honest the moment the list paginates.
     *
     * **Grouped by day**, and the grain is the whole reason this is
     * affordable rather than three queries. A day answers every
     * question the panel asks — the spine bins days into whatever width
     * its range wants, the lane grid sums the days inside the window,
     * and the header sums all of them — where a month grain answers
     * only the last of those and would need a second, date-bounded
     * aggregate for a window that straddles two months, which the
     * default one does. `443`'s eleven months come back as roughly two
     * thousand rows, which is a few kilobytes and one round trip.
     *
     * Also grouped by action, because the edit lane's own breakdown
     * reads it and a stack segment is a source.
     *
     * **And the day map is keyed by `AuditActionMeta::group`**, which
     * costs nothing here — the grouping was already by day *and*
     * action, so the split is a different fold over the same rows —
     * and is what lets three lanes come out of one aggregate. A flat
     * per-day total cannot be divided afterwards.
     *
     * `first_by_action` is per action rather than per group, because
     * the one question asked of it is about `add` alone: when this
     * value's oldest surviving record was created here.

     * readings of one union cannot disagree; two unions can.

     * is five anchor kinds over two tables, 5 to 26 queries — a price
     * for a lazily-loaded panel a reader is looking at, and not for a
     * number on a tab bar that renders on every page load whether or
     * not anybody opens the tab.
     *

     * draws what it says it draws; a proposal is somebody's edit rather
     * than somebody's writing, and the change strip that makes one
     * legible is the tab's. But the *empty* state has to know about
     * them, because *nobody has written about this value* over a value
     * carrying three open proposals is the one sentence this card must
     * not print. They come free — the union already holds them.
     *
     * **Event reports, also only as a count, and that one is not
     * free.** `29-overview.md` §10 routed the count to the Overview and
     * the list to the tab, and named this card over a seventh fact cell
     * because it already mirrors the tab that holds the list; §14.8
     * deferred it as an amendment to a built panel. It costs the one
     * query `analystReportCount` runs, over the event ids the anchor
     * read already returned.
     *
     * **And the standing, since phase 35, which is free.** The card
     * draws the tab's tug-bar over it — the one object on the
     * Collaboration tab that is a shape rather than a list, and the
     * one thing on this card that is not capped at four items. A value
     * with two notes and six opinions can fill the preview with notes
     * and show the reader no opinion at all; the bar is over every

     * which modules this reader may be offered and what the profile
     * declared, and the store, for what any of them last said. Where
     * the declaration marks a module `auto` and the instance permits

     * those at `viewEnrichmentBadge` — so the panel itself paints at
     * the speed of a database read whether or not a module is up,
     * which is the property that makes an enrichment surface on this
     * tab possible at all.
     *
     * **A stored answer is drawn here rather than fetched.** The tab
     * fires its `fresh` dispositions because its panes are empty until
     * a request fills them; this panel's are not, so `fresh` arrives
     * already drawn and only `fire` leaves the browser. The difference
     * matters on an instance with the gate off: `mode=auto` is refused
     * there, and a module a colleague ran by hand last week would
     * otherwise have no way to reach the page.
     *
     * **The blob comes back one row at a time**, by `one()`, because
     * `forValue()` deliberately does not select it — the catalogue
     * wants a roster and this wants an answer, and the roster is read
     * on every Enrichment tab open. One indexed lookup per module the
     * panel will draw, which is bounded by what has actually been run
     * against this value.

     * *Already in MISP* "what stops an analyst adding a duplicate".
     * `New since <date>` is a delta against a previous run and is
     * gone; this is a question about the database right now, so it
     * needs no memory at all.
     *
     * `Value::prevalenceFor` is the right instrument and was built for
     * a different panel: it probes many values at once as separate
     * indexed equality lookups, caps each one, and applies the
     * reader's ACL — so the chip means *already in MISP **and** you
     * can see it*, which is the only version of the claim this page
     * may make.
     *
     * **Only values MISP would correlate on are asked about**, per
     * `enrichmentCorrelates`. A row the probe is not asked about is
     * `known => false` and wears no chip, which is the honest state:
     * the page did not look, because there was nothing worth looking
     * for. This is what stops `count: 1` and `rrtype: A` from wearing
     * a duplicate warning.
     *
     * **Type-scoping the probe is not the fix, and was measured
     * before being rejected.** `28b-known-probe.php` compared an
     * untyped probe against one statement per distinct type over all
     * three modules: not one of the objectionable chips went away,
     * because MISP genuinely holds a `counter` with value 1 and a
     * `text` equal to `A`. The claim was true and useless, so the cure
     * is asking about fewer values rather than asking more precisely
     * — and it costs one statement fewer rather than six more.
     *
     * That filtering is also what keeps this under
     * `PREVALENCE_PROBE_CAP`. 200 rendered `passive-dns` objects carry
     * 1,400 attribute values against a 1,500 cap; dropping the three
     * relations of seven that MISP does not correlate on leaves ~800,
     * where the old code ran up against the cap and silently probed a
     * prefix.
     *
     * **One query for the whole result**, whatever the module
     * returned, and the value the page is about is excluded: every
     * module echoes the subject back, and telling a reader that
     * `8.8.8.8` is already in MISP on the page for `8.8.8.8` is noise.

     * event view's own Redis-backed check — and it is asked about every
     * type the value is stored under, because a `sha1` seen once as an
     * `md5` would otherwise escape the list it is on.
     *
     * **The category is resolved, not read.** `07-reference.md` §3.1
     * verified that no shipped list sets one and that
     * `Warninglist::__updateList()` drops the field on import, so the
     * order is: the profile's override map by exact list name, then
     * the shipped name map, then the database column, then
     * `false_positive` — the column's own default and what MISP's
     * warning banner has always meant by a hit. `WarninglistCategory`
     * owns the whole order, including why the shipped map sits *above*
     * the column, and every hit carries the `source` that answered it
     * so the panel can name it (§3.2, §5 item 12).
     *
     * **A refuting hit outranks a contextualising one.** Where a value
     * hits both a `false_positive` list and a `known` one, the
     * resolution is `false_positive`: the first says *this is not an
     * indicator*, the second only says *this cannot be attributed to
     * one tenant*, and the clash between the second and wide reporting
     * is what phase 3's escalation names.

     * The clusters named by the events this value occurs in, which are

     *
     * A reader who has just seen *APT29* on the Overview's context card
     * and reads *"no galaxy on any occurrence"* two panels away is
     * being told two true things that sound like a contradiction. They
     * are not: the event tag says *this report is about APT29*, the
     * occurrence tag would say *this indicator is APT29's*, and only
     * the second is an attribution. `Value::ownTagsFor`'s docblock
     * draws the same line, with the same example.
     *
     * The distinction is worth keeping rather than softening. A report
     * on an actor cites sandbox artefacts, public infrastructure the
     * malware touched and services it abused — `8.8.8.8` reaches an
     * APT29 event because something resolved a name, not because APT29
     * runs it. Counting event tags as attribution would pay every
     * indicator in that report for one analyst's judgement about the
     * report, which is how a verdict engine ends up calling Google's
     * resolver an actor's asset.
     *
     * So this exists to let the ledger *say* the events are labelled,
     * and for nothing else. It returns counts, the caller hands them to
     * the signal's own eligibility filter, and no points ride on any of
     * it.
     *
     * **The cluster ACL still applies.** A galaxy tag names a cluster
     * the reader may not be allowed to know exists, so the names go
     * through `galaxyClusters()` exactly as the context card's do, and
     * a tag with no row behind it is dropped rather than counted. The
     * events themselves need no test: they came from
     * `occurrenceEventsFor`, so each one holds an occurrence this
     * reader may already see — `taggableEventIdsFor` makes the same
     * argument for the context card.
     *
     * ATT&CK-shaped clusters are dropped on `verdictGalaxies`' own
     * rule: a technique on the carrying event is not a near-miss
     * attribution, and counting one would put *T1071.001* behind a
     * sentence about actors, families and campaigns.
