 * The value-identity seam for the Value Profile page.
 *
 * The subject of that page is a value string — `185.234.219.24`, a hash,
 * a domain — which is not a row of any table. It is a set of attribute
 * rows that happen to carry the same string, so this model has no table
 * of its own and resolves the value against `attributes` instead.
 *
 * `useTable = false` is established practice here: `Community`, `Module`
 * and `EventLock` all do it.
 *
 * **This is the only file in the Value Profile feature that names
 * `value1` or `value2`** (prd/value-profile-live/00-contract.md §14.3).
 * A feature is coming that moves `attributes.value` into a table of its
 * own — possibly several, split by type. This page does not build it,
 * does not wait for it and does not assume its shape; what it does is
 * arrange that when it lands, one file changes. Verification is a grep:
 * those two column names must not appear in ValueProfile.php, in
 * app/Lib/Tools/Value*.php, in ValuesController.php or under
 * app/View/Themed/Overmind/Elements/Values/.
 *
 * Identity is the value, not the pair `(type, value)`. A composite
 * attribute therefore contributes two identities, which is the reading
 * `Sighting::saveSightings` already takes when it matches value1 OR
 * value2 to write a sighting by value.

     * The labels on the **events** this value occurs in, most-carried
     * first and bounded.
     *
     * `topTagsFor`'s event-scope twin, and the page was blind to it
     * until 2026-09-14. Every tag surface on this profile — the
     * occurrence tables' Tags column, the Overview's context card, the
     * neighbourhood's label list — joined `attribute_tags` and nothing
     * else, which on this instance means the page was showing a
     * minority of what anybody had said about the value: `8.8.8.8`
     * carries **7 distinct attribute tags** and its twenty events carry
     * **48 distinct event tags** between them, the second set holding
     * every `tlp:`, the `type:OSINT` marking, and the MITRE ATT&CK
     * clusters the context card was reporting as *0 galaxy clusters*.
     *
     * **The count is events, and the caller must not add it to
     * `topTagsFor`'s.** That one counts occurrences carrying a tag;
     * this counts events carrying it. Two units, and the moment a
     * surface sums them or prints them in one column under one heading
     * it has invented a third that means neither — which is the defect
     * the sightings card was carrying a day before this was written.
     *
     * **The ACL is `topTagsFor`'s, deliberately unchanged.** The scope
     * is built exactly as that method builds it — `buildConditions`
     * over the attributes matching the value, `Attribute.deleted = 0`,
     * `Event` and `Object` contained because the rule is not
     * expressible without them — and the event-tag join hangs off the
     * attribute's own `event_id`. So an event reaches this result only
     * by holding an occurrence the reader may already see, and no new
     * visibility reasoning is introduced to get its labels.
     *
     * **A local event tag is not withheld.** `EventTag.local` is an
     * export rule rather than an access one: `excludeLocalTags` is set
     * by `Server::push` and the sync paths, defaults to false in
     * `EventsController::view`, and is a caller-supplied parameter on
     * the API. A reader who can open the event sees its local tags
     * there, so hiding them here would differ from MISP without
     * protecting anything. `local` rides along so the chip can carry
     * the same marker the attribute tags' chips do.
     *
     * **Two statements, and the second is the reason.** The obvious
     * shape is one query — join `attributes` to `event_tags` on
     * `event_id` and group — and it is the shape this was first written
     * with. It costs what it costs because the join happens *before*
     * the grouping: `443` has 48,255 occurrences across 1,844 events,
     * so every one of an event's tags is multiplied by every occurrence
     * the value has in it. The pair of calls `forContext` makes
     * measured **≈650 ms** on that value.
     *
     * Asked as *which events*, then *which tags on those events*, the
     * multiplication never happens: the first is the same indexed
     * aggregate every other count on this page runs, the second an `IN`
     * against `event_tags`' own index. The pair measures **129 ms** —
     * 122 for the first call and **8** for the second, which is the
     * memo on `taggableEventIdsFor` doing its work.
     *
     * For scale, the `topTagsFor` pair beside it on the same value
     * costs **916 ms**, and did before any of this. This scope is not
     * where that card's time goes.
     *
     * **The `IN` list is bounded by the value's events, not its
     * occurrences**, which is the distinction that makes it safe: the
     * widest value on the instance reaches 1,844 ids, where its
     * occurrence set is twenty-six times that.
     *
     * **Cheap, and cheaper than its attribute twin.** `443`'s 1,844
     * events carry 3,999 event-tag rows and **246 distinct tags** — an
     * order below the 3,860 distinct attribute tags that made
     * `CONTEXT_TAG_CAP` necessary in the first place. The bound is
     * still taken, on `topTagsFor`'s reasoning rather than on a
     * measurement of this one.

     * can see has to be in the total above it (§14.6) — and an
     * assessment has the opposite obligation.

     * The lag is `Event.date` against the attribute's own timestamp:

     * **Which column is "when this was reported" — the open question.**
     *
     * Every aggregate on this model that means *when* currently reads
     * `Attribute.timestamp`, and that column is **last-modified**: an
     * edit, a tag, a sync update or a delete bumps it, and it is what
     * sync compares to decide which copy is newer. MISP stores **no
     * creation date for an attribute**, so there is nothing to swap it
     * for today.
     *
     * What that costs, measured on this instance:
     *
     *   - the relevance clock's occurrence half is `MIN(timestamp)` per
     *     organisation, so **editing an old occurrence moves that
     *     organisation's "join" date forward** and the value reads as
     *     freshly corroborated. `8.8.8.8` shows 223 days of drift
     *     between DECEA's earliest event date and its computed join
     *     date, and 5 of its 26 occurrences were written after their
     *     event was published. Nothing in the data separates *reported
     *     later* from *edited later*;
     *   - `lifecycle.recency` says *"Last reported N days ago"* off
     *     `MAX(timestamp)`, and `lifecycle.continuity` counts a month
     *     of activity for a month that only contains an edit. Both
     *     score, so this reaches the verdict.
     *
     * **The agreed chain, for when the columns exist.** Prefer a
     * declared observation over a row write, and fall through:
     *
     * ```
     * recency   ← Sighting.date_sighting        (already its own clock event)
     *           ← Attribute.last_seen
     *           ← Attribute.first_seen
     *           ← Attribute.created_at          (when it lands)
     *           ← Attribute.timestamp           (last resort)
     *
     * earliest  ← Attribute.first_seen
     *           ← Attribute.last_seen
     *           ← Attribute.created_at          (when it lands)
     *           ← Attribute.timestamp           (last resort)
     * ```
     *
     * Two directions rather than one list, because the same window
     * answers two questions: *when did this organisation first report
     * it* wants the start, and *how recently was it recorded* wants the
     * end.
     *
     * **`created_at` slots in above `timestamp` and below the seen
     * dates** — it is a real creation date, so it beats a row write,
     * and it is still a recording date, so a declared observation beats
     * it. When it lands, the fallbacks in this file and in
     * `ValueRelevanceTool::joinEvents()` are the sites to change, and
     * §3.6's uncertainty rule gains a fourth answer: a value with a
     * `created_at` and no seen dates is datable to its record, which is
     * not the same as datable to its observation.
     *
     * **Units differ and the comparison must convert.** `first_seen`
     * and `last_seen` are `bigint` **microseconds**; `timestamp` and
     * `date_sighting` are seconds. So `last_seen / 1000000`.
     *
     * **Availability, and why `last_seen` leads the recency chain**
     * (2.92M live attributes on the dev instance):
     *
     * | column | set | note |
     * |---|---|---|
     * | `last_seen` | 473,327 (16.2%) | 295,924 of them carry **no** `first_seen` |
     * | `first_seen` | 179,878 (6.2%) | only 2,475 without a `last_seen` |
     *
     * **And the substitution is safe in the conservative direction.**
     * 472,749 of 473,327 `last_seen` values (99.88%) precede the row
     * write, by 4 days on average and 226 at most; 578 follow it and
     * **none** is in the future. So reading the observation instead of
     * the write moves the clock *earlier* — values read staler, never
     * fresher, which is the direction §3.5's asymmetry asks for.
     *
     * Recorded rather than built: the chain changes what every value on
     * an instance reads, and `06-staleness.md` §7.11 is the standing
     * example of why a date this load-bearing gets decided before it
     * gets written.

     * How widely each of many values is spread, for this viewer.
     *
     * `occurrenceSummaryFor`'s `events` count, plural — the denominator
     * the Relationships tab's **Most specific** rank divides by. A
     * neighbour that shares five events with the value is worth
     * clicking if those are five of the six events it appears in
     * anywhere, and worth ignoring if they are five of two hundred;
     * ranking cannot tell those apart without this number.
     *
     * **Viewer-scoped, and that is not a detail.** §14.6 makes every
     * count on the page the reader's own, and the printed fraction is
     * read as *"in 8 of its 204 events"* beside a value the reader can
     * open. A denominator over events they cannot see would both leak
     * membership and disagree with the page they land on. The ACL join
     * costs almost nothing here: 775 ms against 626 ms unscoped over
     * `8.8.8.8`'s 9,520 neighbours, the worst fold on the instance.
     *
     * **One bounded probe per value, which is what stops this scaling
     * with the instance.** Identity and storage disagree on composite
     * attributes: a value is an identity when it is `value1` **or**
     * `value2` (`conditionsFor`, and the reason is in this class's own
     * docblock), while the co-occurrence fold keys its rows on
     * `Attribute.value`, which composes to `value1|value2`. 16% of this
     * instance's attributes are composite and 2,231 of `8.8.8.8`'s
     * 10,040 neighbour keys carry a pipe, so neither reading can be
     * skipped. A key's count is the union of the two: the composed
     * value equals `A|B` exactly when `value1` is `A` and `value2` is
     * `B`, or when `value1` is the literal `A|B` and `value2` is empty.
     *
     * This used to be two `IN` passes that grouped every matching row
     * and rebuilt the union in PHP, and its cost tracked the rows the
     * candidates matched rather than the candidates themselves —
     * `PREVALENCE_ROW_CAP` carries the measurements. Each key now asks
     * its own question, capped, and MariaDB answers it off the two
     * value indexes: `EXPLAIN` reports
     * `index_merge … sort_union(value1,value2)` for the plain shape.
     *
     * **The arms are separate statements, not one condition.** A
     * thousand `(value1 = A AND value2 = B)` arms OR'd into a single
     * `WHERE` took **311 seconds** over this fold and matched far more
     * than it was asked about. Chunking them as `UNION ALL` keeps every
     * arm its own indexed lookup with its own `LIMIT`, which is the
     * only way the cap can bind per value.
     *
     * **Equality, so an absent value costs nothing.** The cap would be
     * no protection if a miss had to scan: 200 values that match
     * nothing cost 98 ms, against the 4.5 s a `LIKE '%…'` shape spends
     * discovering the same thing — the trap recorded at
     * `nearMatches`. Every arm here is an equality on an indexed
     * column, so a value nobody holds is a range lookup that finds
     * nothing.

     * co-occurrence fold print the difference on the row, so they have
     * to be able to tell them apart.

     * **Galaxy and taxonomy tags together, and `is_galaxy` decides

     * so asking for one of them was costing the other a second query
     * once the co-occurrence fold started reading both — the reason
     * §10.2 gives for one table of neighbours rather than two reads.
     * A galaxy tag is still worthless until `fetchGalaxyClusters` says
     * the viewer may know its cluster exists; that ruling belongs to
     * the caller, and the flag is what lets it find the names to ask
     * about.
     *
     * **Grouped, not fetched.** A value can occur 48,255 times, and the

     * SQL rather than materialising occurrences and folding them in
     * PHP. `attribute_tags` is joined explicitly because it is a
     * `hasMany` that would otherwise cost its own query per id, and the
     * answer needs no attribute rows at all.

     * The colour and the flag join the grouping rather than riding
     * along outside it: they are constant per tag, but MySQL under
     * `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` recognises that only through a key it can
     * see, and a selected column it cannot prove constant is an error
     * rather than a guess.
     *
     * The event scope is the caller's, and it is what makes the ACL
     * argument short: those ids came from `occurrenceEventsFor`, so the
     * events are ones this viewer may read. `buildConditions($user)` is
     * still applied, because an attribute inside a readable event can

     * in 32,922 objects reaches **32,893** `datetime` rows on the
     * verification instance, so a lane tallying what it drew would draw
     * eleven years of dates as whichever fortnight the cap left it.
     *
     * The day comes from the left ten characters of the stored value
     * rather than from a date function, because the column is a string:
     * MISP validates a `datetime` attribute to ISO 8601, so the first
     * ten characters are its calendar day in every row and the grouping
     * needs no parse. A row whose value is not a date groups under
     * whatever it starts with and is dropped by the caller's own parse,
     * which is the same rule the rows take.
     *
     * **Grouped by relation as well as by day**, and the second half is
     * what lets the lane name its own vocabulary honestly. The rows it
     * draws are the newest cap-many, so tallying relations from those
     * would report `0.0.0.0`'s eleven kinds of date as whichever one
     * happens to be newest — and it is not a close call there:

    /**
     * Every proposal that is about this value, from either direction.
     *
     * **Two scopes, and the instance holds exactly one row that proves
     * both are needed.** Proposal 12 proposes `2.2.2.3` against
     * attribute 1495259, which holds `2.2.2.2`:
     *
     * - `2.2.2.2` reaches it only through the *target*, and what it
     *   says there is *someone proposed replacing this*.
     * - `2.2.2.3` reaches it only through the proposal's own columns,
     *   and what it says there is *someone proposed this as a
     *   replacement*.
     *
     * Sixteen of the other seventeen attribute-targeted proposals carry
     * the same value as their target and are reached both ways, which
     * is why the union is deduplicated by id rather than concatenated.
     *
     * **Two statements and not one `OR`.** The two scopes sit on
     * different columns of different tables — `ShadowAttribute.value1`
     * and `Attribute.value1` — and an `OR` spanning them is the shape
     * that cost the co-occurrence panel a full table scan. Each half
     * here matches a prefix index of its own: `shadow_attributes` has
     * `value1(255)` and `value2(255)`, the same shape `attributes`
     * carries.
     *
     * **The target scope is a join and not an id list.** `old_id` is a
     * `belongsTo` to `MispAttribute`, so `ShadowAttribute::buildConditions`
     * has already joined `Attribute` in order to express its own ACL —
     * which means the value predicate can be written against that join
     * for nothing. The alternative was `old_id IN (occurrence ids)`,
     * and on `443` that is an `IN` list of 48,255 integers.
     *
     * **The gate is MISP's own**, `ShadowAttribute::buildConditions`,
     * which is what `ShadowAttributesController::index` uses. It is not
     * the attribute ACL with an extra clause: `value-profile-coverage.md`
     * §2.2 found that a standalone proposal (`old_id = 0`) is OR'd past
     * the whole attribute-and-object distribution test, because there is
     * no attribute to test, and is therefore gated by **event visibility
     * alone**. That is looser than the occurrence fetcher, and it is
     * MISP's rule rather than this page's — so it is applied as MISP
     * wrote it and stated here rather than tightened silently.
     *
     * Soft-deleted proposals are kept. A withdrawn proposal is still a
     * dated thing that happened to this value, and the row says so —
     * unlike the co-occurrence panel, whose subject is what the value
     * currently sits beside.
     *
     * **`reach` narrows to one scope, and costs a query rather than
     * saving one.** The Timeline's lane wants both and pays two
     * statements for them. A caller after *standalone* proposals wants
     * only `proposed`: a proposal with `old_id = 0` has no target
     * attribute for the `target` scope's join to match, so that half
     * can never return one and running it is a second statement whose

     * section's rows, which are the same query against two scopes.
     *
     * **Rows and not an aggregate, deliberately, and this is the one
     * place on the page where that is the cheaper answer.** The panel
     * needs six things per neighbour — how many events it shares, when
     * it was last seen with us, which organisations reported it, which
     * events, which object template, what distribution — and five of
     * them are multi-valued per neighbour. As aggregates that is one
     * `GROUP BY` per column, each re-scanning the same rows;
     * `GROUP_CONCAT` would fold them into one query but appears nowhere
     * else in MISP and is not portable. Scanning the rows once and
     * folding in PHP costs one query and gives all six.
     *
     * It is only affordable because **the caller has already bounded
     * the scope**, which is the whole of the co-occurrence design: the
     * event set is chosen and capped before this runs, so the row count
     * is bounded by a number the panel prints rather than by how
     * popular the value is. §14.4's warning about counting in PHP is
     * about tallying *a page* and calling it a total; this folds the
     * complete scope and the panel states what the scope was.
     *
     * `Attribute.value` — the virtual field — rather than the two
     * columns, so a composite neighbour reads `example.com|1.2.3.4` the
     * way it does everywhere else in MISP.
     *
     * Soft-deleted rows are excluded. The Occurrences tab reveals a
     * soft-deleted occurrence *of this value* because the reader is
     * asking about that value's history; a withdrawn attribute in the
     * same event is not something this value co-occurs with.
