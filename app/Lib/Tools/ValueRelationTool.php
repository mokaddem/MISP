 * The Relationships tab's aggregates.
 *
 * Pure and static, and it takes no `$user` — the shape
 * prd/value-profile-live/00-contract.md §14.5 requires. Every method
 * here folds rows the owning model has already scoped, so nothing in
 * this file can widen what a viewer sees.
 *
 * It exists rather than growing `ValueStatsTool` for the same reason
 * `ValueDecayTool` did in phase 23: one tab's notion of *related* is a
 * self-contained argument, and the folding rules below — how a value
 * with two types gets one badge, which audiences a group of
 * occurrences reports, how a sibling seen five hundred times becomes
 * one row — are decisions this tab owns and nothing else reads.
 *
 * **What is not here.** The correlation table. Section one of this tab
 * is not correlation-engine output and cannot be: a
 * `default_correlations` row links two attributes that carry *the same*
 * value, so for one value the engine returns other occurrences of it —
 * which is the Occurrences tab — and its CIDR/ssdeep partners, which
 * are section two. Nothing in it ever returns a *different* value.
 * `24-relationships.md` §3 has the argument and the measurement.

         * **The labels, in a fold of their own.**
         *
         * §10.2 asked for one table over both, *"with the same facets,
         * ranks and pager over all of it"*, and building it is what
         * showed that only the last of those three is shareable. Of a
         * value neighbour and a galaxy cluster:
         *
         *   - the **rank** cannot be shared. Shared events counts the
         *     events the attribute budget afforded on one side and
         *     every event the value is in on the other, so on `443` a
         *     value reaches 38 and `tlp:white` reaches 196.
         *   - the **facets** cannot be shared. Five of the eight are
         *     properties of a correlated attribute, and a cluster has
         *     no type, no object and no warninglist verdict.
         *   - the **columns** cannot be shared. Two of them are empty
         *     on every label row.
         *
         * Which leaves the pager, and sharing that was the worst of it:
         * merged, the first cluster on `Malicious` was on page 14.
         *
         * This panel had already written the rule down, one section
         * below where the merged table went — *"a facet like Type is a
         * property of a correlated value; an event row is not a value,
         * and filtering one by the type of the other would be a control
         * that means nothing."* A cluster is not a value either. So the
         * labels get what the object siblings above them get: their own
         * rows, their own bar, their own pager.
         *
         * **After the two lookups above, and that part is unchanged.**
         * Both are keyed on an attribute value string and a tag is free
         * to be named `8.8.8.8`; folding labels through them would let
         * a tag inherit a warninglist verdict belonging to an address
         * that merely spells the same. Their own array now makes that
         * structural rather than merely ordered.
