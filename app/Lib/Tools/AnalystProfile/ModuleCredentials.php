/**
 * Which enrichment modules cannot answer until somebody configures
 * them, and which settings they need.
 *
 * A module enabled but unconfigured is the quietest failure this page
 * has: the declaration saves, the row looks healthy, the box arrives
 * ticked, and the analyst finds out by pressing Run and reading an
 * error. Three of the twelve modules the shipped default names are in
 * exactly that state on a fresh instance.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot be derived, with the receipt
 *
 * Introspection carries `meta.config` — a flat list of setting names —
 * and **nothing that says which of them are required**. The obvious
 * heuristic, *a module with config keys needs them set*, is wrong for
 * most of the roster and wrong in the worst direction, because it
 * would cry wolf over the two modules the default profile most relies
 * on:
 *
 * - **`mmdb_lookup`** declares `custom_API`, `db_source_filter` and
 *   `max_country_info_qt`, and with none of them set it queries
 *   CIRCL's `ip.circl.lu` and works. Its own `features` text says so:
 *   *"by default. The module can be configured with a custom mmdb
 *   server url if required."*
 * - **`dns`** declares `nameserver` and resolves through `8.8.8.8`
 *   without it.
 * - **`circl_passivedns`** declares `username` and `password` and can
 *   do nothing at all without them — its `requirements` say *"A CIRCL
 *   passive DNS account with username & password"*.
 *
 * Same shape, opposite answers. So membership is editorial and ships
 * as code, following `ModuleLocality` and `WarninglistCategory` before
 * it, and for the same stated reason.
 *
 * ## Silence is the safe direction here
 *
 * The opposite of `ModuleLocality`'s rule, because the risk runs the
 * other way. An unlisted module is assumed to work unconfigured, so an
 * incomplete roster's failure mode is *a module that fails on press
 * with no warning* — which is the status quo for every module, and
 * exactly what it was before this file existed. A roster that guessed
 * instead would put a warning on rows that are fine, and a warning
 * that is usually wrong is worse than none: it teaches the reader to
 * ignore the real ones.
 *
 * So this names only modules whose own `requirements` or `features`
 * text states the need, and says nothing about the rest.
