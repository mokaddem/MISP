/**
 * The editor's mechanics: what each section of a profile looks like as a
 * form, what a posted form does to the document, and which edits are
 * refusable before they are saved.
 *
 * prd/analyst-profile/09-editor.md, phase 8a. **This file renders
 * nothing.** It produces a *view-model* — a description of the document
 * in blocks and fields — and three deliberately different designs
 * (phase 8b) draw the same view-model three ways. The seam exists
 * because two of those three designs get thrown away and the mechanics
 * should not go with them.
 *
 * ## Four block kinds, and no fifth
 *
 * A section is a list of blocks; a block is one of four shapes. D2 says
 * the sections have genuinely different shapes and deserve different
 * treatments, and this is that statement made mechanical — a template
 * that can render four block kinds can render all seven sections,
 * including a section a later phase adds.
 *
 * - **`fields`** — labelled scalars. `thresholds`' supermajority,
 *   `relevance`'s clock, `enrichment`'s reuse window. A numeric field may
 *   carry a `unit` — the suffix a design draws after the input — because
 *   without one the settings smuggle their unit into the key name
 *   (`ttl_days`, `undated_assumed_days`) and the ones that do not are
 *   read in whatever unit the reader guesses.
 * - **`map`** — key→value pairs with an *add* affordance and a named
 *   source for the keys. `relevance.ttl_days`, `reference.org_trust`,
 *   `enrichment.locality`. Never a row per candidate key: the source is
 *   what the picker searches, not what the table lists (§4). A row's
 *   value may itself be a map — `enrichment.auto_run` is a module→state
 *   one (D17), which is why it is no longer a multiselect: a checklist
 *   has two states and the declaration has three.
 * - **`items`** — a list of togglable entries, each with its own fields.
 *   `signals`, `escalations`, `exclusions`. An item carries its state as
 *   well as its values, because a profile may name a signal this
 *   instance does not have and the palette has to say so rather than
 *   drop it (`03-signals.md` §4.4).
 * - **`strip`** — the quality bands against the attainable bound. One
 *   block, one section, and it exists because a boundary is only wrong
 *   *relative to* something and the something has to be drawn.
 *
 * ## A field addresses itself by path, and the form posts nested names
 *
 * Every field carries `path` — its segments from the root of
 * `parameters`. A template turns that into
 * `data[AnalystProfile][parameters][signals][reporting.independent_orgs][points][per_org]`,
 * which PHP parses back into the same nested array, and `merge()` needs
 * no per-section code to apply it.
 *
 * Nested bracket names rather than a dot-joined string, because the keys
 * are not safe for a separator: a signal id contains dots
 * (`reporting.independent_orgs`), an attribute type contains a pipe
 * (`domain|ip`), an organisation key is a uuid. PHP replaces `.` only in
 * the part of a parameter name before the first bracket, so keys inside
 * brackets survive verbatim — checked rather than assumed.
 *
 * ## The lists are addressed by id and stored as lists
 *
 * `signals`, `escalations` and `exclusions` are JSON *arrays* in the
 * document and *maps keyed by id* in the form, because a position is
 * not a stable address — a save that renumbered would rewrite the entry
 * the analyst was not looking at. `merge()` is where the two
 * representations meet, and it is the one place that knows the document
 * is a list.

         *
         * **And there is no ledger group.** It was a select on every
         * signal row and it is the one control here that cannot change
         * an assessment: `group` picks the heading a row is read under
         * and touches no arithmetic. The default is already right —
         * every signal declares its own in its implementation — and
         * overriding it puts a row under a heading whose note
         * (`ValueVerdictTool::groupNote()`) then describes something
         * else, or under a custom heading with no note at all. So the
         * densest pane in the editor paid eleven selects for an outcome
         * that was either invisible or wrong.
         *
         * The **document** keeps the key: `anchor()` still resolves
         * `$entry['group'] ?: $signal->group`, so a profile that arrives
         * by import or by the Raw JSON pane with a `group` set is still
         * honoured. What went away is the control, not the schema —

     * `enrichment` — which modules the profile declares, for which
     * attribute types, and where each of them answers from.
     *
     * Nothing auto-runs (D15): the tab arrives with these ticked and a
     * run still takes a press, because MISP records nowhere that a
     * module has run and "run the defaults on page open" therefore
     * means running them on every page open.
     *
     * ## Keyed by module, though the document is keyed by type
     *
     * `auto_run` stores `type => {module: state}` and this block draws
     * `module => {type: state}`. The transpose is the whole redesign,
     * and it is arithmetic rather than taste. Measured on the dev
     * instance: **194 attribute types, 146 modules**, and the block
     * drawn the other way round was a 194-key map whose every row
     * offered all 146 — a table nobody could read and nobody could
     * maintain.
     *
     * Three facts make the transposed one small:
     *
     * - **A module declares what it accepts.** `mispattributes.input`
     *   has been there all along and the editor never read it, so a
     *   reader could file `virustotal` under `pdb` and hear about it
     *   only from the value tab, as `C_TYPE_MISMATCH`, long after.
     *   Median module accepts **3** types; 80 of 112 accept four or
     *   fewer. A row is short.
     * - **Rows are bounded by what an administrator enabled**, not by
     *   what MISP can store. Nine modules are enabled on the dev
     *   instance; the whole editable surface is nine rows.
     * - **Most types have no module at all.** The 146 accept 71
     *   distinct types between them, so 123 of the 194 could never
     *   have meant anything, and offering them was offering a
     *   declaration that could not resolve.
     *
     * ## The transpose costs nothing, once the tab is read correctly
     *
     * It looked like it did. The argument was that a type this map
     * does not carry keeps every enabled module *ticked*, so naming
     * one module for `ip-dst` would silently untick the rest — a
     * consequence visible keyed by type and invisible keyed by module,
     * which would need a second block to state.
     *
     * **The premise was false, and the old block blurb said it too.**
     * `value_enrichment_rail.ctp` builds `$picked` from
     * `$enrichment['profile']['selected']` and checks a box only for a
     * name in it, and `selected` holds exactly what the profile
     * declared for the types this value has. Measured on `8.8.8.8`
     * with the shipped default: **5 eligible modules, 3 ticked** — the
     * three declared, not five minus the declared. A module the
     * profile says nothing about arrives **unticked**, always.
     *
     * So the declaration adds ticks rather than removing them, there
     * is no hidden un-ticking to disclose, and a per-type summary
     * would have been restating the rows above it.
