/**
 * The directory read that makes a signal available.
 *
 * D12 (prd/analyst-profile/03-signals.md §8): signal implementations are
 * **discovered from the filesystem, not registered in code**. An admin
 * drops a PHP file in `app/Lib/ValueSignals/` and it is picked up;
 * nothing anywhere holds a list of the eleven shipped ones.
 *
 * MISP has built this loader twice and this follows both rather than
 * inventing a third shape. `Workflow` scans two roots — a shipped one
 * replaced on upgrade and a custom one never touched — memoises the
 * scan behind an initialised flag, and keeps loading failures in
 * `$error_while_loading` for the UI to show. `DecayingModel` builds its
 * formula catalogue out of a directory listing minus `Base.php`, which
 * is why the decay UI's formula dropdown is already a directory read.
 *
 * **One subject per pair of roots.** Two of them today — signals, and
 * the conflict rules that make a lean contested — each with its own
 * base class and its own two directories, and both inheriting every
 * rule below.
 *
 * The five rules a directory that executes its contents needs:
 *
 * 1. **Discovery is not activation** (§8.3). This class says what
 *    exists; a profile's `signals` list says what runs. A copied file
 *    moves no score on the instance until someone edits a profile.
 * 2. **A colliding id is refused, not overridden** (§8.4). Shipped
 *    files load first and keep their ids; a custom file naming one is
 *    logged and skipped. A silent override would mean two instances
 *    rendering the same ledger row from two different computations.
 * 3. **A broken file is an honest state, never a fatal** (§8.5). It
 *    does not parse, the class is missing, the class is not a signal:
 *    logged, skipped, the id unavailable, and the reason kept for the
 *    editor.
 * 4. **One scan per request, and no cache across requests** (§8.6).
 *    An admin who drops a file expects the next page load to see it,
 *    and a Redis-cached catalogue would mean waiting on a key they have
 *    never heard of.
 * 5. **Nothing in the UI ever writes one of these files** (§8.7). No
 *    upload, no in-browser editor. Signals arrive by whatever mechanism
 *    the admin already uses to deploy code.
