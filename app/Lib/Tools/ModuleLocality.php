/**
 * Which enrichment modules answer without anything leaving the
 * instance.
 *
 * Phase 7 of prd/analyst-profile/ needs this and **module
 * introspection does not carry it.** Measured 2026-09-07 against the
 * dev instance's 146 modules: the top-level keys are `name`, `type`,
 * `mispattributes` and `meta`, and `meta` runs `author`, `config`,
 * `description`, `features`, `input`, `logo`, `module-type`, `name`,
 * `output`, `references`, `require_standard_format`, `requirements`
 * and `version`. Not one of them says whether asking the module tells
 * a third party that somebody is looking at the value
 * (`08-enrichment.md` §1.3, §3.1).
 *
 * ## Why it cannot be derived, with the receipt
 *
 * The obvious heuristic is *a module with an API key leaves the
 * building, one without does not*, and it is wrong in both
 * directions:
 *
 * - **`countrycode`** declares `config: []` and `requirements: []` —
 *   nothing to configure, nothing to install — and fetches
 *   `http://www.geognos.com/api/en/countries/info/all.json` over plain
 *   HTTP to expand a ccTLD.
 * - **`clamav`** takes one config key and reaches nothing but the
 *   `clamd` socket the operator pointed it at.
 *
 * So the same shape says both things, exactly as phase 6's fixture put
 * `7` in two weight bands and thereby foreclosed a derived band
 * (**D14**). The knowledge is editorial and ships as code, following
 * `WarninglistCategory`'s V1 and `GalaxyColour` before it.
 *
 * ## The test that decides membership
 *
 * **Does anything about this value reach a party the instance operator
 * does not control?**
 *
 * - **No → local.** Pure computation (`extract_url_components`),
 *   local files (`geoip_*` read Maxmind's database off disk), or an
 *   endpoint that can only ever be the operator's own — `clamav` has
 *   no default connection string at all, so it reaches whatever
 *   `clamd` the operator runs and nothing when they run none.
 * - **Yes → external**, and *configurable* is not the same as
 *   *local*: `mmdb_lookup` defaults to CIRCL's `ip.circl.lu` and
 *   `dns` to Google's `8.8.8.8`, so both leave the building on a
 *   deployment nobody has configured. An operator who has repointed
 *   one records that in their profile's `enrichment.locality` map,
 *   which is the one thing a shipped map can never know
 *   (`08-enrichment.md` §3.2).
 *
 * ## An omission is the safe direction, and it is a real one
 *
 * A module this map does not name resolves `unknown`, and every reader
 * of this class treats `unknown` as `external` — `leavesInstance()`
 * says so in one place so that no caller has to remember it. So the
 * failure mode of an incomplete map is *a local module described as
 * though it might not be*, never *a value quietly sent somewhere*.
 *
 * Nothing here withholds a module. This map labels; the reader decides
 * and presses. The `locality_posture` setting that once turned a label
 * into a refusal has been withdrawn.
 *
 * That the map *is* incomplete is measured rather than hoped: the
 * roster is the modules whose source was read, and reading source is
 * not proof either — **`socialscan` shows no outbound call in its own
 * file** because the library it wraps makes them, which is why the map
 * carries only what it can defend and says nothing about the other 124.
