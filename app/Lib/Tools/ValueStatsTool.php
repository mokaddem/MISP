     * An attribute carries a distribution, so does the object holding it

     * is the conjunction of all three — `MispAttribute::buildConditions`
     * requires the event to allow the viewer *and* the attribute *and*
     * the object, with level 5 passing through. Reporting the attribute's
     * own column instead says `Inherited` for almost every row on a real
     * instance and tells the reader nothing.
     *
     * Two steps. **Inheritance is resolved**: a link at level 5 states
     * nothing of its own and defers outward, and an event can never be 5,
     * so at least one link always states a level. **Then the tightest
     * stated level wins**, by `$restrictiveness`.

     * and no single level says that. It is true only where the ambiguity
     * is real: a level 0 anywhere dominates every other constraint, and
     * the same sharing group stated twice is one constraint, so neither
     * of those sets it.
     *
     * A row with no object must not be read as an object at level 0. The
     * `Object` key is always present after a `contain`, holding nulls
     * where the LEFT JOIN found nothing, so the object link counts only

     * from it: on `8.8.8.8` the strip showed 47 reports and silently
     * dropped 6, under two tiles counting exactly those 6, so the two
     * contradicting kinds were not merely uncoloured — they were
     * absent, and nothing on the card said so.

     * hangs the contradicting types **below the axis**, where they can
     * never share a bar with the support and can never be mistaken for
     * it. This returns the same shape at sparkline scale, so the
