/**
 * The bucket series behind every brushable activity chart on the Value
 * Profile page: the Sightings navigator, the Timeline spine and the
 * History months.
 *
 * All three draw one bar per bucket over a span, and all three had
 * their own loop for turning a span into buckets — with the bucket
 * unit hardcoded in each. The unit is what they actually disagree
 * about, so it is the parameter here rather than three literals there.
 *
 * Why the unit is given and not derived from the span: a bar means
 * something different in each chart. A Sightings bar counts reports,
 * and a report has a timestamp, so a day is an honest grain. A
 * Timeline bar is a density over sources MISP cannot all date to the
 * day, so a month is the finest claim it can make. Deriving the unit
 * from the span alone would let the Timeline draw daily bars it has no
 * right to — so a caller whose data supports it opts in to the
 * span-to-unit rule, and one whose data does not names its unit and
 * keeps it however wide the span gets.

    /**
     * Everything a chart the browser re-aggregates needs: one bucket
     * series per unit the caller's rule permits, over the same span.
     *
     * Phase 21 §13.1 measured why this is affordable at all. A bar is a
     * label and a count, so the value's whole span at every grain its
     * data supports is tens of kilobytes where the sections phase 19
     * stopped shipping were megabytes. The browser can therefore hold
     * all of it and pick a grain per zoom level without going back to
     * the server.
     *
     * **This class ships every string and the browser computes every
     * number.** A grain is two arrays of labels and one array of start
     * offsets, not a list of bucket objects, and the split is the
     * reason: `j M` and `F Y` are decisions, so duplicating them in
     * JavaScript would be a second formatter to keep in step with
     * `describe()`; a bucket's start date and its end date are
     * arithmetic over the span, so shipping them as text costs bytes
     * and settles nothing. Sent as objects, a 437-day span cost 45.8 KB
     * against the 10 KB it costs like this — most of it field names and
     * `Y-m-d` dates repeated five times a bar.
     *
     * `starts` is a day offset from `$from`, and the month grain's
     * first one is normally negative: a month bucket is a whole
     * calendar month at the low end, because a bar labelled `Jun` that
     * begins on the 14th is not June. `null` means the offsets are the
     * identity, which is what `day` always is.
     *
     * A bucket's end is the next bucket's start less one, and the last
     * one ends with the span. So the buckets tile it exactly, which is
     * what lets the browser sum a slice per bar and stop.
     *
     * The grains carry no totals. A count belongs to what is being
     * counted and the caller owns that.
