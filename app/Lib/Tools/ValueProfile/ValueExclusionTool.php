/**
 * Evidence the analyst has decided not to count.
 *
 * The `exclusions` section of a profile: filters that run over a value's
 * evidence **before any signal sees it**, so that two signals reading
 * the same fact read the same filtered set. A ledger whose sightings
 * row says 47 next to a false-positive row computed from 44 is a ledger
 * a reader summing it by hand would be right to complain about.
 *
 * ## Three mechanisms, because the evidence has two classes
 *
 * The specification for this section says exclusions are *"applied to
 * `$context`, once"*, and that turns out to be one sentence describing
 * three different things — because half a value's evidence is computed
 * in SQL and never exists as rows at all.
 *
 * - **A condition** (`orgs.own`). The occurrence tally, the reporting
 *   breadth, the publication split and the monthly activity are
 *   `COUNT DISTINCT` aggregates over the attribute table. Excluding an
 *   organisation from them means excluding it *in the query*, or the
 *   ledger contradicts itself: reporting breadth would drop an
 *   organisation while the occurrence count still included its rows.
 *   So this class of exclusion contributes to `Value::conditionsFor()`,
 *   which is the single place every value-scoped aggregate builds its
 *   predicate, and it therefore reaches all of them at once.
 * - **A row filter** (`sightings.self`). Sighting rows do exist, and
 *   are filtered where they exist — before they are tallied, exactly
 *   as the evidence window already filters them.
 * - **A list fold** (`feeds.mirrored`). One already-fetched list,
 *   deduplicated.
 *
 * What survives from the one-sentence version is the property that
 * mattered: every signal sees the same evidence, because the filtering
 * happens once, during the build, and nothing downstream can opt out.
 *
 * ## `evidence.window` is not here
 *
 * It is an exclusion, it is in the section, and it is applied by the
 * context builder's budget instead — because it decides what is
 * *fetched*, and the others filter what arrived. It also filters row
 * evidence only, where these filter whatever they are pointed at. Its
 * `not_counted` entry comes from the accumulator's budget notes, in the
 * same shape as the ones this file produces.
 *
 * ## No class per id, and no drop-in directory
 *
 * Signals and conflict rules resolve to discovered classes because an
 * instance admin may want ones nobody shipped. An exclusion is
 * configuration the engine applies directly: the four shipped ids
 * operate at three different layers and could not honestly share an
 * interface — one contributes SQL, one filters rows, one folds a list.
 * A custom exclusion would need the expression language the design
 * rejected, so the set is closed and the methods below are it.
