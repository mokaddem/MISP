/**
 * The categorical half of an assessment: what does the record assert
 * this value is?
 *
 * Three axes make up an assessment — what the record says the value is,
 * whether that still matters, and how much of it can be trusted. This
 * file owns the first. It is deliberately not a number: an engine
 * reading MISP's own tables can say *"four organisations flagged this
 * as an indicator and nobody contradicted them"*, and that is a
 * statement about the record rather than about the value. The quality
 * ledger says how thin or thick that record is; the lean says which way
 * it points.
 *
 * ## Stances are voices: one per organisation, at its grade
 *
 * One organisation putting the same value in forty events with `to_ids`
 * set is one voice, not forty. Counting occurrences would let a single
 * prolific reporter outvote everyone else on the instance, and it is
 * the same independence argument the reporting signal already makes
 * about corroboration.
 *
 * **A dispute is a voice too, and never a veto** (D63,
 * `16-signal-corrections.md` §3.1). A false positive or an outside
 * verdict used to decide the lean alone through the lean-disputed
 * check, so one false positive outvoted ten reporters. It is now
 * weighed in the same count:
 *
 * ```
 * threat voices  Σ factor of orgs asserting it (to_ids = 1)
 *                + Σ weight of graded verdicts arguing threat
 * benign voices  Σ factor of orgs that filed a false positive and
 *                  do not themselves assert it
 *                + Σ factor × weight of reporters' own
 *                  false-positive warnings
 *                + Σ weight of graded verdicts arguing benign
 * threat_share   threat / (threat + benign)
 * ```
 *
 * **`to_ids = 0` is no voice** (D69, `16-signal-corrections.md` §4).
 * MISP defines the flag as *use this for detection*; leaving it off
 * says the value is context, noisy, a victim's or simply the type's
 * default — never that it is harmless. Benign comes only from
 * somebody saying so.
 *
 * A reporter that asserts the value and also tags its own report with
 * a false-positive warning keeps one voice, split: `high` or a
 * confirmation moves all of it to benign, `medium` half. A reporter
 * that only recorded it as context gets a benign voice from its
 * warning and nothing else.
 *
 * The factor is the organisation's reliability grade once the
 * profile grades anybody, and `1` until then (D64): `G` abstains, `E`
 * is a quarter voice. A verdict weighs its module's grade, halved
 * where it hedges — the same weight its ledger row is paid.
 *
 * **An organisation's latest statement wins.** A reporter filing a
 * false positive after its own newest `to_ids = 1` row has changed its
 * stance: one benign voice, not a threat voice and a benign one.
 *
 * **An old dispute counts less.** A false positive older than another
 * organisation's newest standing assertion counts at
 * `thresholds.dispute_stale_factor` — the reporters reasserting the
 * value after the dispute is information.
 *
 * ## The rules, first match wins
 *
 * ```
 * 1. nothing this viewer can see                      → none
 * 2. an enabled conflict rule fires                   → contested, named
 * 3. a false_positive list matched and the stances
 *    are not a supermajority the other way            → benign
 *    no voice either way                              → unflagged
 * 4. threat_share ≥ lean_supermajority                → threat
 * 5. threat_share ≤ 1 − lean_supermajority            → benign
 * 6. otherwise                                        → contested
 * ```
 *
 * `unflagged` sits after rules 2 and 3 so a conflict rule still names
 * a contradiction and a resolver address still reads benign through
 * its list.
 *
 * **Rule 3 sits before rule 4 on purpose**, and it is what makes a
 * value's history legible. The day an address lands on the
 * public-resolver warninglist, its lean flips from a rule-6 muddle to
 * rule-3 benign on exactly the same evidence — the profile's knowledge
 * changed, not the rows. A summed score could not have flipped on one
 * new list hit; a rule ahead of the stance count can.
 *
 * Rule 2 sits before rule 3 because precedence needs a guard: a
 * `false_positive` list against nearly unanimous threat stances is a
 * collision of two deliberate judgements, and the conflict rule that
 * names it has to get there before either one wins quietly.
 *
 * A record flagged only by organisations graded to count for nothing
 * has nothing to lean on either, and answers `none` with
 * `decided_by = 'no_voice'`.
 *
 * There is a seventh rule, and it lives with the ledger rather than
 * here: a lean whose anchored lean rows **that are not voices** sum
 * below zero becomes contested, because the record is then disputing
 * its own assertion. On the shipped catalogue that is the warninglist
 * hit. That one cannot be decided before scoring, so
 * `ValueVerdictTool` applies it, and it writes
 * `decided_by = 'lean_disputed'` so the band stops naming the lean the
 * rule discarded.
 *
 * **The lean rows and not the quality**: weighed against the whole
 * ledger the rule would fire on thin records rather than contradictory
 * ones — a value with no galaxy, no first-seen, no sighting and
 * nothing recent would trip it on absence penalties alone.
 *
 * ## Why a rule that could not run is reported
 *
 * A signal that fails to load is named in the ledger's `not_counted`
 * list. A conflict rule has no ledger row to be missing from — it
 * contributes nothing to the quality — so a rule that could not run
 * would leave the lean unescalated with no trace anywhere the reader
 * looks. That is a silent change of answer, so `rule_errors` comes back
 * beside the lean and is rendered with it.
