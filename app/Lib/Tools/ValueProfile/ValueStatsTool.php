     * An attribute carries a distribution, so does the object holding it
     * and so does the event holding that, and MISP's own visibility rule
     * is the conjunction of all three — `MispAttribute::buildConditions`
     * requires the event to allow the viewer *and* the attribute *and*
     * the object, with level 5 passing through. Reporting the attribute's
     * own column instead says `Inherited` for almost every row on a real
     * instance and tells the reader nothing.
     *
     * Two steps. **Inheritance is resolved**: a link at level 5 states
     * nothing of its own and defers outward, and an event can never be 5,
     * so at least one link always states a level. **Then the tightest
     * stated level wins**, by `$restrictiveness`.

     * and no single level says that. It is true only where the ambiguity
     * is real: a level 0 anywhere dominates every other constraint, and
     * the same sharing group stated twice is one constraint, so neither
     * of those sets it.
     *
     * A row with no object must not be read as an object at level 0. The
     * `Object` key is always present after a `contain`, holding nulls
     * where the LEFT JOIN found nothing, so the object link counts only

     * The Overview card's sparkline: 90 days in 40 columns, all three

     * it.
     *
     * Off the same rows the Sightings tab charts, which is the point of
     * it living here rather than being a fifth query of its own. The two
     * panels sit on the same page and a reader can see both at once, so
     * they must not be able to disagree about how busy the last 90 days
     * were.
     *
     * **It draws all three kinds, not type 0 alone.** *A false positive
     * is not a quiet week, and drawing it as one would put a
     * contradiction into the same bar as the support* — the argument is
     * right, and drawing only type 0 does not follow from it: the strip
     * would silently drop the contradicting reports under two tiles
     * counting exactly those, so they would not merely be uncoloured —
     * they would be absent, and nothing on the card would say so.
     *
     * The tab's own chart answers this: `sightingSeries`
     * hangs the contradicting types **below the axis**, where they can
     * never share a bar with the support and can never be mistaken for
     * it. This returns the same shape at sparkline scale, so the
     * geometry a reader learns on one surface reads the same on the
     * other.
     *
     * `up` and `down` are separately peaked by the caller, and the two
     * halves are sized in proportion so that one unit is one height on
     * both sides — a chart where four false positives out-drew forty
     * sightings would be a worse lie than the omission.
     *
     * The columns are folded from a dense per-day tally rather than
     * bucketed straight off the rows, so the day arithmetic is
     * `ValueProfileBuckets`' and not a third copy of it.
