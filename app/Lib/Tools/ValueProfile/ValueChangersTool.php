/**
 * What would change this — derived, one line per axis.
 *
 * An assessment that cannot say what would move it is an opinion. The
 * card that carries these lines has existed since the page's first
 * pass with the sentences written by hand, which was fine as a mockup
 * and useless as a claim: a hand-written falsifier is a promise nobody
 * checked against the arithmetic that would have to honour it.
 *
 * So each line is computed, and computed the honest way — by asking the
 * derivation itself. The lean line appends organisations to a copy of
 * the context and re-runs the lean rules until the answer changes, so
 * the sentence is true by construction rather than by a second
 * implementation of the same precedence. The quality line asks the
 * banding what a hypothetical quality would band as, so a clamp or a
 * minimum-signal count cannot be quietly ignored by the prose.
 *
 * **The cheapest changer per axis, not all of them.** A reader wants
 * the nearest edge, and three lines of *"and also, 40 more
 * organisations"* is noise. Where two changes are equally cheap the one
 * that firms the record's own assertion is preferred, because that is
 * the direction a reader is usually checking.
 *
 * **Nothing here knows a signal by name.** The quality line needs a
 * unit a reader can supply more of — an organisation, a sighting, a
 * galaxy cluster — and it gets it from the signal's own `$unit`
 * declaration, so a rule dropped into an instance's own signal
 * directory can be named in a falsifiability line without this file
 * changing.
