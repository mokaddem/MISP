/**
 * Why the lean is the lean, in one sentence.
 *
 * `ValueSummaryTool`'s sibling and `ValueChangersTool`'s: all three
 * turn a finished assessment into English, all three are pure
 * functions of the array the engine returned, and none of them touches
 * a database or a view. Staying pure is what lets a test harness reach
 * the exits no instance happens to occupy.
 *
 * **Nine exits.** `ValueLeanTool::leanFor()` has eight and
 * `ValueVerdictTool`'s lean-disputed check is the ninth — the only one
 * decided *after* the ledger, and without its own sentence it would
 * borrow the sentence of the lean it had just overturned.
 *
 * **Voices get a second sentence.** Once a dispute or a grade enters
 * the count (D63, D64) the headcounts stop adding up to the share,
 * and *10 of 11 organisations assert this is a threat* under a
 * contested-looking false positive says nothing about why it did not
 * flip. `voicesSentence()` names the weights and every dispute.
 *
 * **Why every exit gets a sentence.** Of `leanFor()`'s seven exits only
 * a loaded escalation produces prose of its own. Without this, an
 * ordinary value would state *Asserted threat* and never say by whom,
 * on what count, or against which threshold — *Asserted threat,
 * quality 19* with a provenance line carrying only *Computed at render
 * · Analyst profile default-v1*. The stances that decide it —
 * `threat_orgs`, `benign_orgs`, the share and the supermajority in
 * force — are computed on every value, and this is what reads them.
 *
 * **It reads the exit rather than re-deriving it.** `decided_by` is
 * the engine's own name for the branch it took, and the false-positive
 * listing and the benign supermajority are why that matters: both
 * answer `benign`, and which one a value takes depends on an order of
 * writing that is invisible from outside the function.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a second opinion.** Every clause names a key the
 * engine emitted. A sentence disagreeing with the badge above it or
 * the organisations table below it would be a defect in the wording,
 * not a second computation.
 *
 * **It says what the record asserts, never what the value is.**
 * *Organisations assert this is a threat* is
 * a statement about the record; *this is a threat* is the claim an
 * engine reading MISP tables cannot make.
