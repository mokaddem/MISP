 *
 * The first thing on the page and the last thing converted: the strip
 * is the page frame's, the frame is fetched synchronously, and a query
 * added here is a query on the critical path of every page load. So it
 * is built from `Value::occurrenceSummaryFor` and the type group-by the
 * banner chips already pay for, and nothing else — every cell it cannot
 * fill from those two is absent rather than bought.
 *
 * **No `$user`**: what reaches this is already the viewer's, and a
 * tool that could re-scope its answer is a tool that can get the scope
 * wrong in a second place.
 *
 * **Every cell jumps to the tab holding the rows behind it**, so no
 * figure on the strip is a dead end — which is also why the tab ids are
 * asserted against the registry rather than copied by hand: a tab id
 * can be renamed, and a hand-copied link goes on naming a tab that no
 * longer exists.
