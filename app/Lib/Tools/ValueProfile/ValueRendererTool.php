/**
 * Which widget draws which answer, and which widgets get a slot.
 *
 * The renderers say what they can draw; this says what is actually in
 * front of the reader. It takes the runs a value has in the store,
 * sorts their objects into shapes, asks each renderer whether it can
 * draw what it was handed, and returns the ones that said yes with
 * their computed data — then ranks them, because the Overview has room
 * for five and a value can easily have eight answers.
 *
 * ## Grouping is by template and nothing else
 *
 * An object goes to the renderer that claims its template. The loader
 * guarantees at most one claim per template, so the grouping cannot be
 * ambiguous and no precedence rule is needed. An object whose template
 * nobody claims goes nowhere and stays a chip, which is the honest
 * fallback rather than a defect.
 *
 * ## One widget per shape, and the newest answer takes it
 *
 * Where three modules all returned a geolocation, the strip shows one
 * map and the rest fold into chips. The alternative — one widget per
 * module — is three maps of the same address filling the row, which is
 * the roster this design refused wearing a different hat. The
 * renderers merge the answers they are given and each says in its own
 * output which sources agreed; what *newest* decides is only the
 * headline, so a re-run visibly wins.
 *
 * ## The fallback order is an opinion, and it lives here
 *
 * A profile ranks shapes and most profiles rank nothing, so a stock
 * instance needs a sensible order rather than an arbitrary one. It is
 * per attribute type, because what matters first about an address is
 * not what matters first about a hash. It is **not** in the shipped
 * default profile: that document is neutral by construction and a
 * promotion order is a preference. In code it is a shipped default
 * that any profile overrides by saying something.
