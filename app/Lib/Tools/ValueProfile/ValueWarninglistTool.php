/**
 * Which of a set of values MISP already knows to be benign.
 *
 * The page's **one** warninglist read. The frame's *Warninglist hit*
 * chip is fixture-built today (`value-profile-page.md` §1.4) and the
 * verdict card's band with it, so when the Overview's live phase runs
 * it converts onto this rather than inventing a second regime — which
 * is the §14.10 frame-versus-panel hazard, one level up.
 * `24b-relationships.md` §7.
 *
 * **It is the event view's check, not a re-implementation.**
 * `Warninglist::attachWarninglistToAttributes` is the batched,
 * Redis-backed path core already uses on every event page: one `mget`
 * over `misp:wlc:<md5(type:value)>` keys for the whole set, the misses
 * computed and written back. The cache is keyed on the pair alone, so
 * an event view that has already checked `1.1.1.1` warms this lookup
 * and this lookup warms the next event view.
 *
 * **`to_ids` is deliberately not consulted.** Core gates that check on
 * `to_ids || MISP.warning_for_all`, because there it is asking *should
 * this attribute have been exported*. Here the question is *is this
 * value known-benign infrastructure*, which is a property of the value
 * and not of one occurrence's export flag — and a co-occurrence row
 * folds many occurrences that need not agree on it. The probes below
 * are therefore throwaway lookup keys carrying `to_ids`, not records:
 * nothing stored is being described, and nothing is written back.
 *
 * Model-injected and takes no `$user`, the second of the two shapes
 * prd/value-profile-live/00-contract.md §14.5 allows. No `$user` is
 * needed and none would mean anything: which lists are enabled is
 * instance state, identical for every viewer, and the caller has
 * already scoped the values it asks about.
 *
 * Measured on the dev instance, 8 enabled lists over `8.8.8.8`'s
 * neighbourhood: 41.8 ms for the 100 carried rows against 64.5 ms for
 * all 10,040 the fold holds. The fixed cost — `getEnabled` plus
 * building the entry sets, ~30 ms, most of it the CIDR lists — is what
 * dominates, and the marginal cost is ~2.3 µs a value. That is the
 * measurement §7 made a precondition for checking the fold rather than
 * the page, and it is why the facet counts below can be exact.
