/**
 * The profile's enrichment declaration, met with what the instance
 * actually offers.
 *
 * Phase 7 of prd/analyst-profile/ built the declaration under D15 —
 * the profile says which modules matter for a type, the tab arrives
 * with them **ticked, not run**. **Phase 11 built the third state**
 * (`13-auto-run.md`, D24): a module may be marked `auto` and run
 * without a press, where the instance allows it.
 *
 * D15's blocker was real and is gone. Nothing recorded that a module
 * had been asked about a value — `Module` is `useTable = false` — so
 * *"run the declared modules on open"* meant running them on every
 * open. `value_enrichment_runs` is that record, and the reuse window
 * below is what it made meaningful.
 *
 * Auto-run is the one thing here that **widens** rather than narrows,
 * which is why it is the one thing an instance has to agree to:
 * `Plugin.ValueProfile_enrichment_auto_run`, off by default. A
 * profile resolves user → org → instance default, so an analyst can
 * be running under a document they did not write, and without that
 * gate somebody else's declaration would spend their quota.
 *
 * ## The one sentence the whole mechanism reduces to
 *
 * **A profile can only ever narrow what the instance already offers,
 * and every place the two disagree is stated rather than dropped.**
 *
 * `Module::getEnabledModules()` filters on three things — the
 * instance setting `Plugin.Enrichment_<name>_enabled`, the requested
 * type, and `canUse()`, which is site-admin-always and otherwise
 * requires `Plugin.Enrichment_<name>_restrict` to be empty or to equal
 * the reader's `org_id`. A profile picks from the survivors. It cannot
 * enable a module, cannot widen a restriction, and cannot invent a
 * type. What it *can* do is name something that has since been turned
 * off, reserved for another organisation, removed from the modules
 * build, or that never accepted the type it was filed under — four
 * states, all reachable in normal use, and a profile whose stated
 * policy is not the one in effect is the class of quiet lie
 * `01-profile.md` §1.3 forbids. So each one is a condition with an id
 * and a sentence.
 *
 * ## Keyed by attribute type, resolved as a union
 *
 * `auto_run` is keyed by attribute type because module validity is
 * type-scoped: `getEnabledModules($user, $type)` filters on
 * `meta.module-type` and the tab's own header names the type for
 * exactly this reason. A value is several types — `8.8.8.8` is four on
 * the dev instance — so the declaration resolves to the **union over
 * the types the reader actually holds an occurrence of**,
 * deduplicated, and a module declared under two of them is one
 * selection carrying both.
 *
 * The type a selection would run under is the **declared** one where
 * the module accepts it, not the value's most common: the analyst
 * filing `virustotal` under `ip-dst` said which question they wanted
 * asked. It falls back to the row's own default type when the
 * declaration cannot be honoured.
 *
 * ## Locality is a badge, not a gate
 *
 * `ModuleLocality` still says whether asking a module tells somebody
 * outside the instance, and the tab still shows it per module, because
 * a reader deciding whether to press run is owed that. It no longer
 * withholds anything.
 *
 * **The posture is gone** — `locality_posture`, its `cost_posture`
 * predecessor and the `withheld` bucket it filled. It gated the one
 * thing that never needed gating: under D15 nothing runs without a
 * press, so a module arriving unticked and a module arriving ticked
 * both send exactly nothing until the reader acts, and the setting
 * bought a whole vocabulary of refusal in exchange for saving a
 * click. `never` remains, because that is the reader refusing a module
 * outright and it is enforced where a run happens. A stored
 * `locality_posture` or `cost_posture` key is ignored rather than
 * migrated: it selected nothing, so there is nothing to carry.
 *
 * ## `max_age_hours` governs something now
 *
 * The reuse window — how old a kept answer may be before the module is
 * asked again. It was carried and inert for four phases because there
 * was nothing to reuse; since phase 11 a row younger than this is
 * served rather than re-asked.
 *
 * **It bounds automatic reuse only.** A press always asks again: the
 * window is what the page does on its own, and a reader who pressed a
 * button has made a decision a cache must not overrule.
 *
 * No `$user`, no model, no view: the arithmetic and the vocabulary,
 * nothing else, so the tab, phase 8's editor and anything later read
 * the same answer.
