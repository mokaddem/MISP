/**
 * The hover card's payload, folded from an assessment already made.
 *
 * The card is shown when a reader hovers a value anywhere in MISP, and
 * it answers one question: *does this change what I do next*. It is not
 * a small Value Profile — the page says what is true about a value, and
 * this says whether the reader needs the page.
 *
 * **It issues no query and adds none.** Everything below is folded from
 * the verdict envelope and the context that verdict scored, both of
 * which one `forVerdict()` already built. That is the whole cost
 * argument: a hover that cost a second read would be seven more queries
 * on a table with fifty rows in it, and a reader sweeping a column
 * would pay for the page they did not open. `38-hover-card.md` §8.
 *
 * It follows that the card can never disagree with the Assessment tab.
 * It is not a cheaper assessment drawn from cheaper facts; it is the
 * same array, read down to what fits in 400px.
 *
 * @see ValueProfile::forHoverCard
