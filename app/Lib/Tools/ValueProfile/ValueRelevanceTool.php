/**
 * The assessment's second axis: does what the record asserts still
 * matter operationally, today?
 *
 * Phase 5 of the Analyst Profile (`prd/analyst-profile/06-staleness.md`),
 * reworked as the relevance axis by D11
 * (`prd/analyst-profile/12-assessment.md` §2.2). It replaces the page's
 * reading of MISP's decaying models, which answered *how bad is this*
 * and *how stale is this* in one number while the quality ledger
 * already answers the first from more evidence with an audit trail
 * (D7). What is taken is the time factor; what is left is the base
 * score.
 *
 * **No ledger row, ever.** Relevance is its own axis, so nothing here
 * returns points and nothing here can move the lean or the quality sum.
 * That is not a style rule: the first draft emitted staleness as
 * threat-signed points, under which silence promoted a value to
 * definite BENIGN and a freshly-confirmed `8.8.8.8` fell *out* of it
 * (`review-2026-09-02.md` A6). An axis that never touches the other
 * two cannot do either.
 *
 * **Pure and static, and it takes no `$user`** (`00-contract.md` §14.5).
 * Every fact it reads is on the context the owning model built, already
 * scoped to the viewer; it issues no query and resolves no permission.
 *
 * ## The four states
 *
 * ```
 * current              runway ≥ aging_fraction
 * aging                0 < runway < aging_fraction
 * expired              elapsed ≥ ttl
 * timeline uncertain   the clock itself is not trustworthy (§3.6)
 * ```
 *
 * The discontinuity at the boundary is deliberate: **expiry is an
 * event, not a gradient.** A value one day past its TTL reads
 * differently from one a day before it, because that is what a TTL
 * means and it is what makes the relevance falsifiability line worth
 * stating.
 *
 * **Uncertainty is a flag as well as a state**, and the order the two
 * resolve in is an argument rather than a preference. A row-write date
 * is *later* than the observation it stands for, so elapsed-time
 * measured from it is a **lower bound** on the true elapsed time. A
 * lower bound already past the TTL is past it on any honest reading, so
 * `expired` survives an untrustworthy clock; `current` and `aging` do
 * not, and degrade to `timeline uncertain`. Both facts travel, so the
 * page can read *"expired · timeline uncertain"* — which is exactly
 * what `12-assessment.md` §3 says the late-encoded phishing URL should
 * say.
 *
 * ## The virtual age, and why it is not a measurement
 *
 * MISP stores **no creation date for an attribute**: `timestamp` is
 * last-modified and `Event.date` is typed by an analyst. The axis used
 * to subtract one from the other and call the difference an encoding
 * lag; on `8.8.8.8` that produced 302 days out of a row last edited
 * the day after its event was published. The number was wrong, it
 * flagged the timeline uncertain, and through
 * `record.temporal_precision` it also took 4 points off the quality.
 *
 * It is replaced by `undated_assumed_days` — **a declared assumption,
 * not a reading.** When no occurrence carries `first_seen`, the value
 * is treated as that many days older than its record, and the page
 * says so in those words. `elapsed_days` is what the runway is drawn
 * from; `recorded_days` is what the rows actually say; `assumed_days`
 * is the difference and is never larger than what leaves one day of
 * lifetime, so the assumption can age a value and can never expire
 * one.

     * to a row-modification timestamp and the axis would call a dead
     * campaign *current*.
     *
     * **One detecting fact, not two. Revised 2026-09-11.** The second
     * was a created-to-published lag — `Event.date` against
     * `Attribute.timestamp`, beyond `lag_uncertain_days`. Neither
     * column supports the reading: `timestamp` is *last-modified*, so
     * a tag, a sync or a delete years later inflates it, and
     * `Event.date` is typed by an analyst and carries the very delay
     * the measurement was hunting. MISP records no attribute creation
     * date at all, so there was nothing to repair it with. It is gone
     * here and from `record.temporal_precision`, which is the only
     * place it reached the ledger.
     *
     * What survives is the question the rows can answer: **is the date
     * the clock measures from an observation date, or a row-write
     * date?** Where the lag was a bad estimate of how much older the
     * value really is, `undated_assumed_days` is a declared assumption
     * about the same thing — visible, editable, and never pretending to
     * be a reading.
     *
     * **A sighting answers it. Added 2026-09-12.** The rule read
     * `first_seen` on occurrences and nothing else, so a value whose
     * clock had just been reset by a sighting was told its timeline
     * could not be trusted — while the number the warning qualified was
     * measured from that sighting's own `date_sighting`, which is an
     * organisation stating *I saw this, at this time*. `8.8.8.8` is the
     * case: last confirmed 2026-08-23 by an independent sighting, and
     * flagged uncertain because none of its 26 occurrences set a field
     * on a different table.
     *
     * So the flag now asks about the clock it qualifies. A
     * sighting-based clock is dated by definition; an occurrence-based
     * one reads `Attribute.timestamp`, which is a row write, and is
     * uncertain unless the occurrences carry `first_seen` to show MISP
     * holds real observation dates for this value at all.

     * would resolve no TTLs and every value in it would silently change
     * shelf life, with nobody having edited anything.
