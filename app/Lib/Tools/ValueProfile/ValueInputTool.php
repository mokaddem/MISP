/**
 * What the reader typed, turned into values.
 *
 * `/values/index` has two ways in — a box that takes one value and a
 * box that takes a pasted list — and they must not disagree about what
 * a value is. One of them redirects to a profile and the other links to
 * a hundred of them; a reader who resolves `hxxp://evil[.]com` and gets
 * an answer, then pastes the same string in a list and gets nothing,
 * has been told the page is unreliable rather than that their input was
 * odd. So both go through this file. `value-index.md` §3, V4.
 *
 * Three functions, and the difference between them is the whole
 * design:
 *
 *   normalise()      one string in, one value out. Splits nothing.
 *   normaliseMany()  a paste in, a list of values out. Splits.
 *   extractMany()    a paste in, the values *inside* it out.
 *
 * `normalise()` splitting nothing is what makes a value containing a
 * separator reachable at all — see the comma rule below.
 *
 * `extractMany()` is the reader's choice per paste and never a
 * default: it finds indicators in prose that the other two bury, and
 * it cannot type about half of what a MISP instance holds. It is here
 * rather than in the controller for the reason the other two are —
 * one parsing tool, so no two ways in can disagree about what a value
 * is (V4).
 *
 * **Nothing here is altered silently.** Both functions report every
 * transformation they applied, because the page renders the reader's
 * own strings back to them and a table whose rows are not the strings
 * the reader pasted is a table they cannot check. `normalise()` returns
 * a `changed` list; `normaliseMany()` returns counts under the same
 * token names, so the two cannot spell a transformation differently.
 *
 * **It does not lowercase.** The shipped schema collates `value1` as
 * `utf8mb3_unicode_ci` but the verification instance runs `utf8mb3_bin`,
 * where `Google.com` and `google.com` are different values — so
 * case-folding here would silently merge two values on one instance and
 * not on the other. Deduplication is exact for the same reason. Case is
 * the resolver's decision to make, once, on the miss path
 * (`value-index.md` §1.2, §7.1).
 *
 * Pure and static, and it takes no `$user`:
 * `value-profile-live/00-contract.md` §14.5. It reads no table, so
 * §14.3's `value1`/`value2` rule is satisfied by having nothing to say.

     * **Still pure, and still takes no `$user`**
     * (`value-profile-live/00-contract.md` §14.5). `ComplexTypeTool`
     * accepts a TLD list and a security-vendor domain list, and
