/**
 * Which labels a surface draws first, and which it draws even when the
 * value does not carry them.
 *
 * MISP ships 182 taxonomies and 130 galaxies, and to any consumer they
 * are one undifferentiated set in which `threat-actor` sits beside
 * `ukhsa-culture-collections`, `firearms` and `cancer`. Nothing in the
 * data says which of them this reader cares about, because that is not
 * a property of the data — it is a property of the job, and the profile
 * is where this page keeps those.
 *
 * So a profile declares three ordered lists per dimension and
 * everything unlisted keeps the order the surface already gave it:
 *
 *   pinned     always drawn, ahead of everything else, and the only
 *              tier whose *absence* is rendered
 *   preferred  sorted above anything unlisted
 *   demoted    sorted below anything unlisted
 *
 * **Sparse, not exhaustive.** No profile can rank 182 taxonomies and
 * one that tried would be wrong the next time misp-taxonomies ships a
 * release. A typical profile's three lists total about a dozen entries,
 * and `default-v1` declares none at all — which is why a profile that
 * declares nothing must return the groups untouched rather than
 * re-sorting them into the same order by a longer route.
 *
 * **There is no `hidden` tier, deliberately.** Hiding already exists
 * twice at instance level — `taxonomies.enabled = 0` and
 * `tags.hide_tag` — and a third mechanism at profile scope would mean
 * two people can make a label invisible and neither can see that the
 * other did. `demoted` pushes a taxonomy down; it never removes it. A
 * configuration that can make a `tlp:red` tag invisible to a reader
 * who has access to it is a way to mislead somebody about the value in
 * front of them.
 *
 * **Pure and static, and it takes no `$user`**: the caller has already
 * applied the ACL, as `GalaxyCategory` does today. It resolves nothing
 * and queries nothing — including the instance-enablement floor of
 * `absent()`, whose permitted set is read by the caller and passed in.

     * incoming order deciding, and the incoming order is a count.
     *

     * profile that declared nothing, which is the one thing
     * `declares()` exists to prevent.
