/**
 * The contested layout's three keys: the two cases, and what neither
 * case could take.
 *
 * `ValueSummaryTool`'s sibling and under the same rule — pure functions
 * of a finished assessment and the context it scored, no query and no
 * view. They are together in one file because they are one
 * design: a contested record is *two arguments and the things that
 * belong to neither*, and splitting the pair across two tools would let
 * the two halves drift.
 *
 * ## The cases are the lean ledger, read twice
 *
 * A contested lean is re-anchored threat-signed before it is banded
 * (`ValueVerdictTool`'s lean-disputed check), so the **lean** ledger
 * already holds both arguments: the positive rows are what says this is
 * a threat and the negative rows are what says it is not. The cases
 * fold out of those rows and out of nothing else, which is what lets a
 * reader add up either column by hand and arrive at the tug bar above
 * it: *two derivable quantities, no third bucket, no separate
 * computation.*
 *
 * **The lean ledger and not the whole one.** Splitting every row by
 * sign would seat corroboration breadth and temporal precision inside a
 * case titled *Reads as a threat*, and every absence penalty inside one
 * titled *Reads as benign*. Those rows weigh the record; they do not
 * read the value, and a case is a reading.
 *
 * **Exactly two, in order, or none at all.** `value_verdict_conflicted`
 * reads `$cases[0]` and `$cases[1]` positionally and its tug has two
 * feet, so one case or three would not degrade — it would produce an
 * undefined index. A pair is the contract.
 *
 * ## And what neither case could take
 *
 * `conflicts` and `ambiguities` are **one derivation shown in two
 * places**, which is what makes them cheap. They are separate keys but
 * not separate facts: a contradiction the engine had to settle by rule
 * rather than by
 * evidence belongs under the ledger on the agreeing layout and under
 * the two cases on the contested one, and it is the same contradiction
 * either way. One producer, two placements, and the two cannot
 * disagree.
 *
 * What does **not** go in them is anything the ledger netted off. The
 * exact-sum invariant means a fact that moved the quality is visible as
 * a row and adding it here again would be double-counting in prose.
 * Only two facts on this page survive scoring without being scored, and
 * both are resolutions by rule:
 *
 *   1. An organisation holding the value **both ways** — some of its
 *      occurrences carry `to_ids` and some do not. `ValueLeanTool`
 *      counts it with the asserters, because one occurrence carrying
 *      the flag is an assertion; its other occurrences are not netted
 *      off anywhere.
 *   2. **Warninglists that disagree** about the kind of listing. When
 *      hits resolve to more than one category the context settles on
 *      `false_positive`, and the `known` reading is then carried by no
 *      signal at all.
