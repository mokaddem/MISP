/**
 * A value in a URL segment, both ways.
 *
 * The Value Profile page's subject is an arbitrary string — a hash, a
 * domain, a URL with slashes in it — so it travels base64-encoded. Two
 * controllers need the same encoding: `ValuesController` mints it and
 * `AnalystProfilesController`'s simulator takes it as `?value=`.
 *
 * It lives here rather than on either of them for two reasons. One is
 * the ordinary one — two copies of an alphabet decision drift. The
 * other is `ACLComponent`: its
 * `findMissingFunctionNames()` reads controller files with a regex and
 * treats every method whose name does not begin with an underscore as
 * an action needing an ACL entry, so a controller's helpers have to be
 * `__`-prefixed to stay out of the report. A method named
 * `__decodeValue` that another class calls reads as private while being
 * shared API, and that is a wart the check's convention creates rather
 * than a design anybody chose. Out here the question does not arise.
 *
 * **Decoding does not throw.** It answers `null` for anything it cannot
 * read, and each caller raises its own 404 with its own wording — an
 * HTTP exception from a tool would put the transport layer's vocabulary
 * in the one place that has no transport.
