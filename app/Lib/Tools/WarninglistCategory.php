/**
 * Which warninglists mean *shared infrastructure* rather than *false
 * positive*.
 *
 * `warninglists.category` exists — `varchar(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT
 * 'false_positive'`, validated against exactly
 * `['false_positive', 'known']` — and **nothing sets it.** Verified
 * against the sibling `misp-warninglists` checkout: `0` of `89`
 * `list.json` files carry a `category` field. And the gap is one layer
 * deeper than that, because MISP core would drop the field even if
 * upstream set it: `Warninglist::__updateList()` saves exactly
 * `['name', 'version', 'description', 'type', 'enabled']`, for shipped
 * lists and for `import()` alike. The column is only settable on custom
 * lists, through the add/edit controller path, which is why it is not
 * dead code (`07-reference.md` §3.1).
 *
 * Three things on the Value Profile page depend on the distinction, and
 * one of them cannot work without it at all: the escalation
 * `conflict:known-infrastructure-vs-reporting` requires
 * `warninglist_category: known` in its `when`, so **without a category
 * source it can never fire** — phase 3 shipped a rule that could not
 * reach its own precondition.
 *
 * ## Why the knowledge is code and not a store
 *
 * A category is a *fact about the list* — a Cloudflare edge range is
 * shared infrastructure regardless of who is looking — so the right
 * long-term home is `misp-warninglists`, where it serves every instance
 * and every non-MISP consumer of the repo. That path is currently dead
 * on arrival, so §3.3 stages the fix: **this file is V1**, a static map
 * following the `GalaxyColour` precedent — canonical knowledge shipped
 * as code, deterministic, no migration, no store. **V2** is two PRs
 * (upstream sets the field; core imports it), after which every entry
 * here is redundant and the file empties or goes.
 *
 * The retirement criterion is mechanical rather than editorial, which
 * is what `retirable()` is for: every roster entry's database row
 * carries the same category this map hardcodes.
 *
 * ## The test that decides membership
 *
 * **Can a competent report naming this value as malicious be
 * simultaneously true?**
 *
 * - **Yes → `known`.** The hit *contextualises* the report; acting on
 *   the value has collateral. An AWS range is `known` — C2 on EC2 is
 *   routine, and the address really is Amazon's.
 * - **No → `false_positive`.** The hit *refutes* the report, which is
 *   probably an extraction error or the impersonation target. An
 *   RFC1918 address is meaningless in shared intel by definition; a
 *   public DNS resolver stays `false_positive` because `8.8.8.8`
 *   reported as an IOC is nearly always an artifact of resolution
 *   logging — which is exactly how the benign demo value reads it.
 *
 * So the roster is shared and multi-tenant infrastructure plus research
 * scanners, and everything else — structural artifacts (`rfc*`,
 * `empty-hashes`, `tlds`), popularity lists (`tranco*`, `cisco_top*`,
 * `alexa`), vendor telemetry noise — stays `false_positive`, which the
 * fall-through already says. **The map carries only `known` entries.**
 *
 * ## Keyed by name, and that is fine
 *
 * `warninglists` has no `uuid` column and upstream lists carry none
 * either; MISP core itself matches shipped lists by name on every
 * update, so a rename upstream is already a new list as far as core is
 * concerned. Name-keying is no more fragile than the platform
 * underneath it. The residual risk — a renamed list silently losing its
 * entry — is handled by the standing requirement that the panel states
 * **which source supplied the category**, so a lost entry is visible
 * rather than silent.
