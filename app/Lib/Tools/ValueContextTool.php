/**
 * What the community has labelled this value, folded for the Overview.
 *
 * The one panel in the Overview's phase whose shape is produced nowhere
 * else on the page, and the reason it is not a flat tag list is that a
 * taxonomy is the unit that can disagree with itself: two events
 * putting `tlp:amber` and `tlp:green` on one value is a fact about the
 * value, and a flat list hides it.
 *
 * **Three rulings are MISP's and not this tool's**, which is the whole
 * design:
 *
 * - **What counts as a conflict** is `Taxonomy::getTagConflicts` —
 *   an exclusive taxonomy carrying two predicates, or an exclusive
 *   predicate carrying two entries. It also knows that `tlp:white` and
 *   `tlp:clear` are one colour under two spellings rather than a
 *   contradiction, which is exactly the special case a rule invented
 *   here would have got wrong.
 * - **Where a tag sits on a scale** is the taxonomy's own
 *   `numerical_value`, read from the entries rather than assumed from
 *   the order they were imported in.
 * - **Whether a galaxy cluster may be named** is
 *   `GalaxyCluster::fetchGalaxyClusters`. A galaxy tag on a row this
 *   viewer may read is not permission to name the cluster behind it.
 *
 * **What reaches it is already capped.** `Value::topTagsFor` returns
 * the most-carried labels and no more, because a value like `443`
 * carries 3,860 distinct tags; the `capped` flag is how this tool
 * knows not to read a position off a list that stops.
 *
 * **No `$user`**, per §14.4: everything reaching this has been scoped
 * already, and a folding tool that could re-scope is one that can get
 * the scope wrong somewhere the ACL is not being reviewed.
