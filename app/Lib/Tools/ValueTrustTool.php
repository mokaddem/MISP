/**
 * What the analyst believes about their sources, turned into a number
 * the ledger can carry.
 *
 * Phase 6 of prd/analyst-profile/, implementing the first half of
 * **D6**: `reference.org_trust` grades organisations on the admiralty
 * scale and `reference.org_trust_scale` says what each grade is worth.
 * Both live in the profile because **MISP has nowhere else to put
 * them** — `admiralty-scale` is a taxonomy, taxonomies reach MISP as
 * tags, and nothing in MISP attaches a tag to an organisation
 * (`07-reference.md` §2.1). The Verdict tab has been printing
 * `CIRCL: B` from the fixture since the skeleton pass with no store
 * behind it.
 *
 * ## The one sentence the whole mechanism reduces to
 *
 * **Trust weighting replaces a count of organisations with a weighted
 * count of organisations, and a count of their rows with a weighted
 * count of their rows.** That is all three trust-weighted signals:
 *
 * ```
 * reporting.independent_orgs   count(orgs)      → Σ factor
 * sightings.volume_recency     count(sightings) → Σ count × factor
 * sightings.false_positive     count(fp)        → Σ fp × factor
 *                              extra orgs       → Σ factor − 1
 * ```
 *
 * Every one of those degenerates to the unweighted number when every
 * factor is `1.0`, which is what makes §5 item 1 — *the same ledger to
 * the unit* — arithmetic rather than luck. The cap is applied **after**
 * the weighting and the rounding happens **once**, in
 * `ValueSignalBase::row()`: rounding per organisation and then summing
 * produces a number that does not match the same calculation done the
 * other way (§2.4).
 *
 * ## The map is the switch
 *
 * An empty `org_trust` map does not merely weight everything at `1.0` —
 * **it takes the mechanism out of the path entirely** (`inForce()`).
 * The distinction matters because the scale is data too: an analyst who
 * edits `unrated` to `0.5` and grades nobody would otherwise silently
 * halve every score on the instance. With the map as the switch,
 * `unrated` only means something once there is a graded organisation
 * for it to contrast with, and `01-profile.md` §1.3's *"empty means as
 * before"* holds structurally instead of numerically.
 *
 * ## Keyed by uuid, resolved to ids once
 *
 * The profile keys grades by `organisations.uuid` and never by
 * `org_id`, because an id is local: the same organisation carries
 * different ids on different instances, so a profile keyed by id would
 * grade the wrong organisation after an export/import or against a
 * peer (§2.2). Everything downstream — the org rows, the sighting rows
 * — carries the local id, so the uuid→id resolution happens once,
 * where the `organisations` table is in reach (`ValueProfile::
 * verdictTrust`), and the context carries the joined result. A graded
 * uuid that matches no row on this instance is **kept, ignored and
 * reported** rather than dropped: the organisation may return, or the
 * profile may have been written elsewhere (§4).
 *
 * ## An organisation this viewer cannot name is unrated
 *
 * A sighting under `Plugin.Sightings_anonymise` arrives with its
 * `org_id` zeroed, so it cannot be graded and the question does not
 * arise. What can arise is an organisation whose id is on the row and
 * whose name is not disclosed — and grading *that* would change the
 * number for a reason the reader cannot see, which is precisely what
 * §2.5 forbids. So it is treated as unrated. The rule costs a little
 * accuracy on a configuration almost nobody runs and it keeps the
 * evidence line honest on every configuration.
 *
 * No `$user`, no model, no view: `07-reference.md`'s arithmetic and
 * nothing else, so phase 10's worker and the phase 8 simulator read the
 * same numbers as the page.

     * Two deliberate departures from copying the numbers outright

     * much as its reports.
