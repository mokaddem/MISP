build_world_outline.py — the value profile's map thumbnail.

Generates the SVG world outline the Value Profile's geolocation
renderer draws its points on, from the same vendored
`world-110m.geojson` the dashboard's map widgets use. The output is a
CakePHP element holding one `<symbol>`:

    app/View/Themed/Overmind/Elements/Values/Renderers/world_outline.ctp

**Why a baked path rather than the dashboard's renderer.** The
dashboard draws maps with ECharts (`charts.module.mjs`, kind `geo`),
which costs ~740 KB of bundle plus the 437 KB GeoJSON before a single
country appears. The geolocation widget's thumbnail is ~180x88 inside
a strip whose whole argument is that it paints at the speed of a
database read, so it gets the outline as markup: same source data,
same projection, no request and no script. The pane-sized rendering
uses the same symbol at a larger size.

Projection is equirectangular, which is the projection a rectangle
already is: x = longitude + 180, y = 90 - latitude. Antarctica is
dropped rather than drawn and clipped — it is a third of the height of
a world map and none of the answer to *where is this address*, so its
vertices are not worth the bytes. The templates that `<use>` the
symbol crop to 84N..58S in their own viewBox.

Three reductions, all about the size of the string this bakes into a
template: each ring is simplified with Douglas-Peucker at TOLERANCE
degrees, coordinates are rounded to DECIMALS, and a ring whose
bounding box is under MIN_SPAN degrees on both sides is dropped — at
thumbnail scale such a ring is a sub-pixel speck. At the defaults the
outline is ~39 KB of path data (~10 KB gzipped) for 258 rings.

Run from the repo root:

    python3 app/files/scripts/build_world_outline.py

No third-party dependency. Run again after every world-110m.geojson
re-vendor.
