 * Value Profile controller, mounted at /values/* via CakePHP's default

 *
 * The subject of these pages is a value string — `185.234.219.24`, a hash,
 * a domain — not a single attribute row. The same value exists as many
 * attribute rows across many events, and this controller aggregates them.
 *
 * Read-only: nothing here writes. Every number is fixture data except on
 * the tabs the live campaign has converted — Occurrences (phase 22),
 * Sightings (23), Relationships (24), Timeline (25), Collaboration (26),
 * History (27) and Enrichment (28) — which it does one panel at a time,
 * so the two regimes sit side by side until it finishes.
 * `prd/value-profile-live/00-contract.md` §14.12 is the record of which
 * panels have moved.
 *
 * **One action leaves the building**, and it is the only one:
 * `viewEnrichmentRun` queries a third-party module. It still writes
 * nothing to MISP — see its docblock for what that costs instead, and
 * why it is the page's only POST.
