 * Every profile this reader may see, with the one in force named
 * first and unmistakably.
 *
 * The commonest confusion this feature can create is an analyst
 * editing a profile that is not weighting their pages — they forked,
 * forgot, and their organisation's still wins, or their own is
 * disabled. So the rail is the resolution order and every row carries
 * its own standing, which is computed rather than drawn.
 *
 * Since D45 there is a second way to be confused, and it is the one
 * MISP creates by shipping six profiles: a reader may have *chosen* a
 * profile rather than forked one, and a choice can stop resolving
 * without anybody touching it — the profile is deleted, or switched
 * off. `$unresolved` is that, and it is drawn above the table rather
 * than on a row, because the row it is about may no longer exist.
 *
 * The right column is the reader's own standing rather than a tool:
 * what scores them, what this instance permits, and what travels with
 * them into the editor. Its three blocks are all *answers about this
 * visit*, which is the one thing the table's rows cannot be.
 *

 * What each scope answers with.
 *
 * The rail used to count the rows a scope *owns*, which is a different
 * question and gives a different number: MISP's six shipped profiles
 * carry no `user_id` and no `org_id`, so an organisation that has
 * *chosen* one owns nothing, counted zero, and read as having no answer
 * on the very page whose winning row said *Your organisation chose it*.
 * Ownership is one of the two ways a scope answers (D45) and the rail
 * is headed *resolution order*, so it reports the answer itself.
 *
 * The order here is `resolutionFor()`'s: an owned enabled profile
 * first, then the uuid the scope declared, and a declaration that did
 * not resolve is a reason rather than a name. The instance owns
 * nothing ever — it names one.
