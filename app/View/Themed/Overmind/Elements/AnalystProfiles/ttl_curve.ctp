/**
 * The lifetime the numbers beside it describe, drawn.
 *
 * MISP's polynomial at the profile's own decay speed —
 * `1 − (elapsed / ttl)^(1 / speed)` — over the shortest bucket, with
 * the aging mark where the fraction says it falls and, when a value is
 * on the bench, where that value sits on the line.
 *
 * Inline SVG and no client JS: the curve is a function of four numbers
 * the server already has, and a chart library loaded to draw one
 * polyline is a chart library loaded for nothing.
 *
 * **It redraws on every edit all the same.** The figure sits in the
 * relevance section and the editor's recompute only ever swapped the
 * bench, so moving the decay speed changed the numbers under it and
 * left the line it is a picture of exactly where it was — the one
 * control on this page whose whole point is the shape it makes. The
 * recompute now carries this element back with the bench and the editor
 * swaps both (`analyst-profile.js`), which keeps the arithmetic here,
 * on the server, rather than growing a second copy of the polynomial in
 * JavaScript to animate it with.
 *
 * **It draws three bands, because the axis has three states.** The
 * first version marked day 60 `aging` and ended the plot at the
 * lifetime with a bare `90` on the tick — so the only labelled
 * threshold was the first one, and `aging` read as the end of the line
 * rather than as the middle of three. It is asked, and the answer was
 * not on the figure. The x-axis runs past the lifetime now, the curve
 * stays flat on zero out there, and `current` / `aging` / `expired` are
 * each named under the stretch they own.
 *
 * @var array $block The `ttl_buckets` map, a row per bucket
 * @var array $section
 * @var array|null $runway The bench value's relevance, when there is one
