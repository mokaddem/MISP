/**
 * The outline: the whole document on the left, one section of it open
 * on the right.
 *
 * Grouped rather than flat, because a flat list of ten made a reader
 * read all ten to find the one they came for. The three groups sort by
 * the kind of knob — what counts as evidence, what the engine does
 * with it, and what you look at first — so a reader who knows what
 * they want to change reads one group of five at most, and a reader
 * who does not learns what a profile is made of from the headings.
 *
 * Every section still carries the axis it configures. The two are
 * orthogonal and both worth saying: the group is where a setting
 * lives, the axis is what moving it costs. The counts are settings,
 * not bytes — what a reader wants to know before clicking is how much
 * is in there.
 *
 * `Raw JSON` is the same document seen whole rather than another
 * section of it, so it gets its own heading instead of sitting under
 * somebody else's.
 *
 * @var array $sections
 * @var array $groups Group key => heading, in the order to draw them
 * @var string $open
 * @var string $raw The document, for the Raw JSON row's size
 * @var bool $editable
