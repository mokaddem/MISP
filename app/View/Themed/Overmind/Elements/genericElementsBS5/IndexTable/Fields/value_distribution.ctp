/**
 * Who can actually see this occurrence.
 *
 * Not `Attribute.distribution`, which is `Inherited` on almost every row
 * a real instance holds: an attribute's audience is the conjunction of
 * its own level, its object's and its event's, and that is what the
 * reader is asking. `ValueStatsTool::effectiveDistribution()` resolves
 * it and `ValueProfile::attachEffectiveDistribution()` stamps it on the
 * row, so every surface that draws the level draws the same one.
 *
 * An element rather than a per-table closure because the Overview card
 * and the Occurrences tab both draw this column over the same rows, and
 * a card and a table that resolve a distribution differently are two
 * answers to one question on one page — which is what the card gave
 * while it rendered the attribute's own column: `Inherited` beside the
 * tab's `This community only`, on the same attribute.
 *
 * The shared `distribution` field renderer has no slot for the two
 * things that have to be said here — where the level came from, and
 * when the badge is understating the restriction. The badge itself is
 * still MISP's own element.
 *
 * Expected:
 *   $row['effective_distribution'] as stamped by the model
 *   $field['sharing_group_line'] (bool, default true) — name the
 *     sharing group on a line of its own. The Overview card passes
 *     false to keep its rows one line each and takes the name in the
 *     title instead.
