/**
 * What the box resolved to, when it did not land on a profile.
 *
 * Three answers, none of them an error page. A value nothing here
 * records is the answer to the question the reader asked
 * (`value-index.md` §7.1, V3), so it is stated plainly and the profile
 * — which says the same thing with the tabs to prove it — is offered
 * anyway. A hit never reaches this element: it is a `303` to the
 * profile, and the profile is the page that says everything else.
 *
 * The third is the refusal over the cap, which says the count rather
 * than truncating to it: a page that assessed the first hundred of
 * three hundred and forty would have dropped the two hundred and
 * forty the reader would never think to check.
 *
 * It carries its own padding because `triage()` renders it as the
 * whole response when a paste is refused, and a fragment that relies
 * on a wrapper the page draws arrives without one.
 *
 * **Nothing here distinguishes a value the reader may not see from a
 * value nobody recorded** (§4.2, §8 G3). There is one *absent* answer,
 * one wording, and it is drawn from `recorded === false` alone — the
 * probe behind it is viewer-scoped, so this element is never told
 * which of the two it is looking at and cannot leak what it does not
 * know.
 *
 * @var array $resolution `kind`, and what that kind carries
