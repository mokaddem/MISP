/**
 * The prompt — one box, and the verb for what pressing it does.
 *
 * Direction A's, taken into C at the pick (`02a-contract.md` §12.3):
 * the caret at the left edge, the live `n/100` counter, the verb that
 * says what pressing will do, and the `Enter` hint. Clear joined them
 * later and sits on the same line, because what it undoes is what the
 * rest of the line did.
 *
 * The counter and the verb are rendered at their empty-box values and
 * moved by `value-index.js` from there. A box that comes back filled
 * after a submission is the case that makes this matter: the server
 * renders `0/100` and *Open profile*, and the script corrects both
 * before the reader can read either, because it runs on
 * `DOMContentLoaded` against the value already in the field.
 *
 * The form is built through `FormHelper` rather than by hand because
 * `SecurityComponent` hashes the fields it emits: a raw `<textarea>`
 * with the right name posts to a blackhole.
 *
 * The textarea refills itself from `$this->request->data`, which is
 * the whole of *the box keeps its content* (§8 G11) — a reader fixing
 * one character does not re-type the value.
 *
 * Under the box is the one question about it: whether what was pasted
 * is a list of values or a text with values in it (§11). It sits
 * there rather than beside the verb because it changes what the paste
 * *means*, not what pressing does, and a reader checks it while
 * looking at what they pasted.
