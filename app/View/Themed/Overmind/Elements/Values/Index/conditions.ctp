/**
 * The conditions strip — under what rules this reader's session is
 * worked.
 *
 * It sits above the box rather than below the answers, because what it
 * says is true of every answer the box will give and a reader meets it
 * before the first one (`value-index/02b-proposal-c.html`, state 1).
 *
 * **Phase 7's occupant is the profile in force.** An assessment is
 * what a set of thresholds made of the record, so *whose thresholds*
 * is the first thing a reader needs in order to read a band they
 * disagree with. The name says which document, the revision says which
 * version of it — a band that moved overnight moved because the value
 * did or because the profile did, and nothing else on the page
 * separates those two — and the scope says whose pages an edit would
 * move, which is the half that can be acted on (D3).
 *
 * **The link goes where the reader may actually go.** `editable` is
 * `AnalystProfilesController::edit()`'s own predicate rather than a
 * guess from the scope, so the offer and the action cannot disagree: a
 * site admin on the instance default is offered the editor they may
 * use, and an analyst on their organisation's profile without
 * `perm_admin` is offered the page that shows the thresholds instead
 * of a link that 403s (§7.5).
 *
 * **No profile in force is a state, not a failure.** A site admin can
 * disable the default, and every assessment on the instance then
 * carries a lean and no quality, because no signal can fire to band
 * one. That is worth saying plainly; it is the one condition on this
 * page a reader could otherwise mistake for a broken engine.
 *
 * **Phase 8's occupant is the method note**, last in the strip and
 * carrying its own block. The sentence above says whose thresholds
 * decided an assessment; the note says what an assessment is at all,
 * and a reader who needs the second needs it before the first means
 * anything. It is a `<details>`, so it costs one quiet line until it
 * is asked for.
 *
 * **Phase 9's occupant is the enrichment store**, between the two:
 * both sentences say under what conditions this session is worked —
 * one names the thresholds that decide an assessment, the other the
 * memory that decides whether a module is asked at all — and the note
 * that explains the vocabulary sits after the facts it explains.
 *
