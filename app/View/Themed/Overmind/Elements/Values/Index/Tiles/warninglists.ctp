/**
 * The warninglists a value is checked against.
 *
 * Every profile draws a warninglist chip when a value is on a list,
 * and the chip is the one thing on the page that can stop a reader
 * taking a confident *Asserted threat* for a finished answer. What it
 * cannot say on its own is how much checking is behind it: a chip that
 * never appears means something different on an instance running eight
 * lists than on one running none.
 *
 * **Enabled, because that is the set that is actually consulted.**
 * `warninglists` holds every list MISP ships; only the enabled ones
 * are matched against a value, so a count of all 97 would describe a
 * capability rather than this instance's behaviour.
 *
 * **Instance policy, not anybody's activity**, which is what makes it
 * safe to show. It says how this instance is configured, and nothing
 * about what any organisation has looked at (D27).
 *
 * One statement over a 97-row table, measured at 1.3 ms.
