/**
 * Where the bands sit.
 *
 * A reader who disagrees with a quality band needs the cut-off before
 * the disagreement is about anything, and the conditions strip already
 * links to the profile that holds it. This is the number that link
 * would take them to.
 *
 * **`min_signals` is on the tile because it is the surprise.** A value
 * scoring 80 still bands `medium` if only two signals fired — quality
 * is high when several independent readings agree, not when one is
 * generous (`ValueVerdictTool::qualityBand()`). That is the one rule
 * here a reader cannot infer from a band they are looking at, and
 * leaving it off would make the tile's two numbers a promise the
 * engine does not keep.
 *
 * **The high cut-off takes the value slot.** It is the threshold that
 * decides whether a record is worth acting on; `medium` is the floor
 * under it and belongs in the qualifying line.
 *
 * **The scale is drawn because this is the one tile whose value is a
 * position rather than a quantity.** *60* means nothing without the
 * 0–100 it sits on, and the three segments are the three bands at
 * their real widths — a profile that moved `high` to 80 draws a
 * visibly narrower one. It carries **no hue**: quality is a magnitude
 * and `value-palette.css` reserves colour for the lean, so the bands
 * separate by ink weight, which is the same *carries* against *lacks*
 * pairing the worklist's quality bar already uses.
 *
 * Free: the thresholds come from the profile phase 7 already resolved.
 * Where a profile declares none, the figures shown are the engine's
 * own fallbacks rather than a blank, because those are the numbers it
 * would actually band with.
 *
