/**
 * Enrichment modules the profile declares.
 *
 * The partner to the store tile: that one says what this organisation
 * has already asked, this one says how much there is to ask. Together
 * they are the whole of what a reader can expect from a value's
 * Enrichment tab before they open one.
 *
 * **Declared, not available, and the wording says so.** The count is
 * `ValueEnrichmentTool::planFor()`'s `declared` — the modules the
 * profile names across all the types it names them for. What a given
 * value's tab offers is that set met with this instance's enabled
 * modules and the value's own types, which is a second question and a
 * `GET /modules` away. Asking it here would put a network call on
 * every load of this page to qualify a number nobody has acted on yet,
 * so the tile promises only what it knows.
 *
 * Free: the declaration is part of the profile phase 7 resolved.
 *
 * @var int $modules
