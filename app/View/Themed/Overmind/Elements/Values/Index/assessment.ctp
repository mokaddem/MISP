/**
 * One worklist row, assessed — **in both of its views at once**.
 *
 * What `ValuesController::assess()` answers, one request per value and
 * five in flight (`value-index.md` §7.3). The fragment replaces the
 * row's fill, and it carries the card body, the compact row's cells
 * and the row's actions together: the pick took A's compact table as a
 * *second view over one model* (`02a-contract.md` §12.3), so switching
 * views must lose neither the reader's place nor their decisions. One
 * fetch that draws both is how that is kept — the toggle is a class on
 * the list and nothing is re-fetched, re-rendered or re-ordered.
 *
 * The cells become the row's own grid items through `display: contents`
 * on their wrapper, so the columns align down the list without every
 * row's cells being hoisted into the markup by hand.
 *
 * **Produced from the payload alone.** No row index, no *found* flag,
 * nothing derived from whether the reader may see this value: §4.2
 * holds that a value the reader cannot see renders identically to one
 * nobody recorded, and that rule is a property of this file. The
 * engine answers both cases the same way and this must not reintroduce
 * the difference — which is checked as a byte diff of two rows rather
 * than by reading them (§7.3).
 *
 * Three axes and one hue: the lean owns the colour, quality is a
 * magnitude drawn with none, and relevance is a word plus a figure.
 * `value_hover_card.ctp` carries that argument at length; this row is
 * the same assessment at a list's density.
 *
 * @var array $assessment `value` and `card`, from
