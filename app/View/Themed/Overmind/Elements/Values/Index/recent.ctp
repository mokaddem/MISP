/**
 * Carried over — the values this reader last opened.
 *
 * The one block on this page whose rows are neither the reader's paste
 * nor an aggregate over `attributes`: it reads ten strings out of one
 * `user_settings` row that this reader put there by opening them
 * (`value-index.md` §7.4).
 *
 * **Yours alone, and it says so.** D27 refuses to name who ran an
 * enrichment because naming the runner tells the organisation which
 * colleague is looking at which value; a recently-viewed list anybody
 * else could read is that disclosure with a different label. The
 * sentence above the chips is not reassurance — it is the reason a
 * reader can use the block without thinking about who is watching.
 *
 * **No lean on the chip.** Ten assessments is ten engine runs spent
 * before the reader has pasted anything, on a block nobody has asked a
 * question of yet (`02a-contract.md` §12.7). The hover card answers
 * for the value under the cursor, at the moment there is one, and
 * costs nothing until then — so each chip is a hover trigger where the
 * instance has the card on, and a plain link where it does not.
 *
 * **A line, not a panel.** An empty one is a sentence in the future
 * tense rather than an empty box, because four empty boxes is what
 * makes a new install read as broken.
 *
 * @var array<array{value: string, at: int}> $recent Newest first

 * `TimeHelper` wholesale with a two-method helper of its own — `time()`
 * and `date()` — so `$this->Time->timeAgoInWords()` reaches
 * `Helper::__call`, returns the empty string, and renders a chip with a
 * blank where the age goes. Nothing throws and the page looks finished.
