/**
 * The method note — what an assessment is.
 *
 * The one piece of prose on the page, and it is here rather than on
 * the profile because this is where somebody meeting the model for the
 * first time arrives. Three axes have to land before a chip reading
 * *Asserted threat* beside a number and the word *aging* parses as
 * anything at all (`value-index.md` §7.6).
 *
 * **It is a legend as well as a definition.** A row of the worklist
 * draws a lean chip, a band word and a relevance word, and a reader
 * who has just been told what the three axes ask still does not know
 * what answers they may give. So each axis carries its own vocabulary,
 * in the chrome the rows use — the same chip, the same colour, the
 * same quiet treatment for the two leans that name no state.
 *
 * **Every word of that vocabulary is read from the engine, never
 * transcribed.** A note listing four leans a fifth release has made
 * five is worse than no note: it is the page teaching a reader a model
 * the engine has stopped holding, and nothing would fail to say so.
 * `ValueLean::TREATMENTS`, `ValueRelevanceTool::STATES` and
 * `ValueVerdictTool::BANDS` are the three sources, and adding a state
 * to any of them adds it here.
 *
 * **A real `<details>`, so it works with no script.** The script's
 * only job is to remember which way this reader left it, which is a
 * per-viewer convenience and lives in `localStorage` — nothing about a
 * value, visible to nobody else, and a store that comes back empty
 * simply gives the default (§7.6).
 *
 * It sits in the conditions strip as its last occupant, so the
 * sentences that say under what rules the session is worked keep the
 * first line and the note takes a line of its own when it is opened.
