/**
 * One module's answer.
 *
 * The fragment `viewEnrichmentRun` returns, injected into the pane the
 * run came from. **Nothing here is stored** — this markup is the whole
 * of the result's existence, and leaving the page loses it.
 *
 * Eight outcomes, deliberately not interchangeable. Phase 12 named
 * four, the live path added three — *refused*, which is MISP declining
 * to ask on the instance's behalf, *ineligible*, which is this page
 * declining a module the reader was never offered, and *unreachable*,
 * which is nothing answering at all, distinct from *timeout*, where
 * the module was asked and ran out of time — and D17 adds
 * *profile_refused*, which is the reader's own declaration saying
 * never. That last one is worded as the reader's own choice rather
 * than as a restriction, because it is the only refusal here they can
 * lift themselves. The distinction that matters most is still the old
 * one: **silent is not failure.** A module that answered with nothing
 * has done its job and reported no knowledge of this value, which is a
 * finding.
 *
 * **`Already in MISP` is the one piece of §8.3's provenance that
 * survives having no store**, and the one that does the most work: it
 * is what stops an analyst adding a duplicate. `New since <date>` was
 * a delta against a previous run and is gone.
 *
 * **A returned object is drawn the way MISP draws a stored one.** An
 * enrichment answer is mostly objects — `mmdb_lookup` returns three,
 * `circl_passivedns` returns hundreds — and the analyst's question is
 * always about the attributes inside them, never about the shell. So
 * the card carries what `Objects/index.ctp` carries (the hexagon, the
 * name, the meta-category, the template's description) and opens onto
 * the same attribute table, with the relation, the value, the type,
 * the category and the IDS flag in columns rather than run together
 * on one line.
