/**
 * What has reset this clock — the relevance axis's evidence rows.
 *
 * The corroboration timeline, newest first and capped: a value
 * corroborated forty times does not need forty rows to make the point,
 * and the newest one is the clock. The cap is a cap and not a
 * permission, so it says how many it left out
 * (`value-profile-live/00-contract.md` §14.6).
 *
 * Shared with the Assessment tab's clock band, where it is the nearest
 * thing the relevance axis has to the quality ledger: the dates that
 * produced the number, each attributed, with the one currently holding
 * it marked. Quality shows every signal that moved it; this shows every
 * observation that moved the clock. Extracted rather than rewritten for
 * the reason `value_relevance_facts.ctp` gives at length.
 *
 * @var array $clock The `relevance.clock` block — `events` and the
 *                   stamp currently in force
 * @var int $cap     How many rows to draw before counting the rest
