/**
 * The tab's contents page: one card per section, each carrying that
 * section's headline number and jumping to it.
 *
 * The tab is seven tables tall and every one of them is worth reading,
 * which is exactly the problem — a reader who wants to know whether
 * anybody asserted anything about this value has to scroll past a
 * hundred co-occurring values to find out. The strip answers that
 * before the scroll: seven numbers in one glance, and a press to land
 * on the one that is not zero.
 *
 * **It holds no data and costs nothing.** Every number here is filled
 * in by the panel that owns it, as that panel lands — the panels are
 * lazily loaded precisely because some of them are expensive, and a
 * strip that computed its own totals would run the 20,000-row scan
 * over again to print one integer. Until a panel arrives its card
 * shows a placeholder rather than a zero, because *not yet read* and
 * *nothing there* are different answers and this tab's whole
 * discipline is not conflating them.
 *
 * **Seven cards over six endpoints.** The co-occurrence endpoint draws
 * two sections — what sits in the same object, and what sits in the
 * same events — so two cards point into the same container, and the
 * first of them is dropped when that panel renders no sibling table.
 * `initRelationSummary` in `value-profile.js` does both.
 *
 * **The units differ and each card says which.** Values, siblings,
 * relations, matches, remote events, references, claims — seven
 * notions and seven units, so nothing here is a total and nothing
 * invites being summed. Same rule the "What is counted" card in the
 * rail states at length.
 *
 * @var array $data

/*
 * In page order, top to bottom, so the strip reads as the contents it
 * is. `anchor` is the lazily-loaded container the card jumps to;
 * `key` is what the panel inside it stamps on itself.
