/**
 * The relevance axis, and everything the number is made of.
 *
 * Extracted from `value_relevance.ctp` so the Assessment tab can draw
 * the axis it was only summarising. Until 2026-09-13 relevance reached
 * that tab as one clause of the hero's sentence and a bare chart in the
 * rail, while lean carried its rule and its per-organisation table and
 * quality carried the whole ledger — two axes showing their work and
 * the third asserting a number. Nothing about the data made that
 * necessary: `$verdict['relevance']` is the same block this element
 * reads, already built by the same `ValueRelevanceTool::relevanceFor()`
 * call, so the tab was holding every fact below and printing one of
 * them.
 *
 * **One element rather than a second rendering**, and that is the point
 * of extracting it rather than writing it. Two panels computing one
 * quantity twice is the defect this corpus has now shipped three times
 * — phase 5's bar against its series, §14.3's *expired* beside
 * *64 days left*, §16's opinion mean — and the axis with no shared
 * element was the axis that broke. The facts are a pure function of the
 * block, so a surface that draws them cannot drift from a surface that
 * draws them; only the chrome around it differs.
 *
 * Everything the number is made of is here, because a TTL with no
 * provenance is how a reader concludes the page is wrong about a value
 * they know well (`06-staleness.md` §3.4): the clock's date and who
 * supplied it, the type that supplied the TTL and whether the value's
 * other types would have given a different one, and the rule in force.
 *
 * Three honest states it must never render as a blank or a zero:
 *
 *   - **nothing has ever corroborated it.** The majority case in
 *     production — one organisation, no sightings — where the clock
 *     falls back to the value's own encoding date and says so.
 *   - **the timeline is not trustworthy.** No `first_seen`, or an
 *     encoding date that lags the event's own dates, so the elapsed
 *     time is measured from something that is not an observation.
 *   - **the sighting half could not be read**, because MISP flagged the
 *     value as over-correlating and the budget left its rows unfetched.
 *
 * The no-clock state is here too, rather than in each caller: a value
 * this reader holds no occurrence of has no date to measure from, and
 * printing `expired` would be inventing an assertion in order to age
 * it.
 *
 * @var array $relevance The `relevance` block, from either
 *                       `ValueProfile::forRelevance()` or the
 *                       assessment's own `$verdict['relevance']`

     * so a value MISP flags as over-correlating — one with hundreds of
