 * One module's answer, in three chips or a number.
 *
 * **Two callers and one output.** The Overview panel includes this for
 * every module the store already holds an answer for, and
 * `ValuesController::viewEnrichmentBadge` renders it on its own for
 * every module that fired on arrival. The fragment is the same either
 * way, which is what stops a chip drawn on page load and the same chip
 * drawn four seconds later from being two different things.
 *
 * The shape rule is `ValueEnrichmentTool::chipsFor` and lives there
 * rather than here: it is arithmetic and vocabulary over a run, the
 * view draws what it decides, and a second opinion in a template is
 * how the two surfaces start to disagree.
 *
 * **A failure draws no chip.** It says so and marks itself, and the
 * panel collects the marked ones into one trailing line — an error
 * competing visually with an answer is noise in a summary. Server-side
 * that grouping is done before this is reached; for a module that
 * fired, the browser moves the row after this lands.
 *
 * When, never who: naming the analyst who ran a module would tell
 * the organisation which colleague is looking at which value.
 *
 * @var array $valueProfile Set when rendered as an endpoint
 * @var array $badge        Set when included by the panel
