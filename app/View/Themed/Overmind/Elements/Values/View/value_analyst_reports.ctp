/**
 * The event reports written about the events this value sits in.
 *
 * The third panel on the Analyst tab, and the one that is a list rather
 * than an argument. `value-profile-coverage.md` §4.5 places reports
 * here — narrative analyst content about the value's context, beside
 * the notes and opinions — and they are a panel of their own rather
 * than more thread items because a report is a document, not a turn in
 * a conversation: dropped between two one-line notes it buries both.
 *
 * **Every row is about an event and says so.** Analyst data attaches to
 * a uuid and a report attaches to an event; nothing attaches to a
 * value. What this panel can state honestly is *a report was written
 * about an event this value is in*, which is the same sentence the
 * thread's event-level items carry.
 *
 * **The audience is resolved, not reported.** A report's own
 * `distribution` is `5` — *inherit* — on every report nobody narrowed,
 * because that is the shipped default, so a badge printing the column
 * says nothing on almost every row. The model resolves the report →
 * event chain through the same helper an occurrence's three links go
 * through, and the badge names the level the reader is actually asking
 * about.
 *
 * **The extract is the head of the report, not a summary.** MISP has no
 * summary of a report and this page will not write one — an abstract
 * the page invented would be the page's claim about somebody's
 * document. The first few hundred characters are the document's own
 * opening, marked as truncated, with the full length beside it.
 *
 * Lazily loaded into `.ajax-tab-content` from
 * ValuesController::viewAnalystReports.
