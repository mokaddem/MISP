/**
 * A short timeline of spans, in lanes, over one shared axis.
 *
 * **Why this is not the Timeline tab's lane grid.** It draws the same
 * marks and deliberately borrows the same CSS — `.vp-lanes`,
 * `.vp-lane-axis`, `.vp-lane-span`, and the `--vp-tl-…` palette — because
 * a span here and a span there must not look like two different claims.
 * What differs is everything around the marks: that grid is redrawn in
 * JavaScript from a JSON feed, over a rolling twelve-month window a
 * brush moves, across eight fixed sources. This one is rendered by the
 * server over **the data's own extent**, with lanes the caller names,
 * and it follows whatever narrowing the surrounding `[data-vp-list]`
 * applies. Sharing the stylesheet and not the machinery is the part
 * that keeps them honest.
 *
 * **The axis is the extent and not a calendar.** A resolution history
 * that ran 2013→2018 is an empty strip under a twelve-month axis, and
 * the reading a span strip exists for — *four addresses in fourteen
 * days, four years of nothing, then one more* — is only visible when
 * the axis is as long as the story.
 *
 * **Every span names its row.** `entries[].key` is the key the table row
 * carries in `data-vp-span-key`, so `VP.spanStrip` can dim the spans of
 * rows a filter has removed. A strip still drawing a span whose row is
 * gone is worse than no strip: it asserts the filter did nothing.
 *
 * @var string $stripId    Namespaced per panel; two strips on one page
 *                         must not collide over an id
 * @var array $stripSpan   `from`, `to` as unix seconds. A zero-length
 *                         span is legal and is padded, so one instant
 *                         still draws a mark rather than dividing by
 *                         zero
 * @var array $stripLanes  [['label'=>, 'token'=>, 'count'=>,
 *                         'entries'=>[['key','value','relation','from',
 *                         'to','origin']]], …]
 * @var string $stripHue   The colour of a span, as a `var(--x)` the
 *                         stylesheet resolves
 * @var string $stripLabel Accessible name for the strip
 * @var string $stripNoun  What one lane holds, for the count column
 * @var string $stripLaneHead What a lane *is*, over the label column.
 *                         The caller owns it because the caller owns
 *                         the grouping: a strip whose lanes are values
 *                         under a column headed `Template` is a chart
 *                         lying about its own axis
 * @var string $stripLaneIcon The lane chip's icon, or `''` for none —
 *                         which is what a value wants, because the
 *                         table printing the same string beside it
 *                         gives it no icon either
 * @var bool $stripLaneMono Whether a lane label is a stored string
 *                         rather than a name. Verbatim and monospace if
 *                         so; see `.vp-strip-tag-mono`
 * @var string $stripNote  One line under the strip, for a grouping or
 *                         a fold the strip picked and the reader did
 *                         not. Empty renders nothing
