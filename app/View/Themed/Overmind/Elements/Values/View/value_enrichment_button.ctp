/**
 * The one control on this page that causes anything to leave the
 * instance — and, since phase 11, its twin that does not.
 *
 * **Enabled, unlike every other control here** — and that is the
 * distinction it exists to draw. The rest of the page's write controls
 * render visibly disabled because the Value Profile writes nothing;
 * this one is live because running a module writes nothing either. It
 * is disabled only for a reader without `perm_add`, which is the bar
 * MISP sets on `attributes/hoverEnrichment` and
 * `events/queryEnrichment` and which this page does not undercut.
 *
 * `mode` is what separates the twins. Without it the press is a press:
 * it always asks the module, because `max_age_hours` governs automatic
 * reuse and a human who pressed a button has made a decision a cache
 * must not overrule. With `auto` it serves a fresh stored answer and
 * asks the module when there is none, which is what the tab's own
 * fan-out sends. With `stored` it asks nobody anything and serves
 * whatever is held, which is what a control offering to show an
 * answer this organisation already has should do.
 *
 * **The quiet button went through `auto` and should not have.** That
 * mode is refused where the instance's auto-run gate is shut — which
 * is every instance by default — so *show me what came back* answered
 * *it was not run on its own*; and where the gate was open but the
 * answer had aged out, the same press became an outbound query
 * nobody asked for.
 *
 * The same `perm_add` bar guards all three, even though the stored
 * path sends nothing: the endpoint decides whether to query, and a
 * control that looked cheaper than it might be would be promising on
 * the server's behalf.
 *
 * A plain partial, not an endpoint.
 *
 * @var array $module
 * @var bool $canRun
 * @var string $noRun
 * @var string $label
 * @var string|null $mode `stored` to serve a held answer and ask
 *                        nothing, `auto` to prefer a fresh one and ask
 *                        when there is none
 * @var string|null $variant `secondary` for the quieter of two
 * @var string|null $runType The type to ask under; the row's default
 *                           otherwise. A stored answer is keyed by the
 *                           type it was asked under, which need not be
 *                           the one this row leads with, and fetching
 *                           it under the wrong one would quietly ask
 *                           the module instead of serving the answer.
