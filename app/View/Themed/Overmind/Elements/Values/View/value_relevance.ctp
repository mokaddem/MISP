/**
 * How fresh this value is, and what made it so — as a rail card.
 *
 * The decay card's replacement (`prd/analyst-profile/06-staleness.md`
 * §4). That card showed one bar per decaying model, each a score MISP
 * computes largely from the value's tags multiplied by a time factor —
 * the same tags the assessment's quality ledger scores directly, with a
 * per-row audit trail and none of the double counting. This card keeps
 * the time factor and drops the base score, so what is on screen is one
 * quantity a reader can act on: **how much shelf life is left, measured
 * from the last time somebody new confirmed the value.**
 *
 * Everything the number is made of is on the card, because a TTL with
 * no provenance is how a reader concludes the page is wrong about a
 * value they know well (§3.4): the clock's date and who supplied it,
 * the type that supplied the TTL and whether the value's other types
 * would have given a different one, and the rule in force. The
 * corroboration timeline underneath is the aggregation rule's second
 * half — naming what holds the number, which is what phase 23 decided
 * for the decay maximum and this inherits (§4.1).
 *
 * Three honest states it must never render as a blank or a zero:
 *
 *   - **nothing has ever corroborated it.** The majority case in
 *     production — one organisation, no sightings — where the clock
 *     falls back to the value's own encoding date and says so.
 *   - **the timeline is not trustworthy.** No `first_seen`, or an
 *     encoding date that lags the event's own dates, so the elapsed
 *     time is measured from something that is not an observation
 *     (§3.6).
 *   - **the sighting half could not be read**, because MISP flagged the
 *     value as over-correlating and the budget left its rows unfetched.
 *
 * **Every fact above is required; none of them was required to be a
 * paragraph.** The card shipped with fourteen lines of explanation
 * around ten lines of data — a TTL line that printed the engine's whole
 * resolution (`shortest rule, over ip-src 90, text 180`), two sentences
 * on what the neighbouring chart does, one on what does *not* move it,
 * and `lower bound`, `encoding date` and `first_seen` where plain words
 * exist. This pass keeps the facts and moves the second half of each to
 * its element's `title`: the per-type day counts, the clock setting's
 * name, the false-positive rule, what an over-correlating value is.
 * Hovers, not sentences, so §3.4's honest state survives at a third of
 * the height. The labels this card invented — `new organisation`,
 * `independent sighting` — carry their definition the same way, which
 * they never did in any form.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewRelevance.
 *
 * @var array $valueProfile
