/**
 * The zoom control over a brushable activity chart.
 *
 * Four buttons and a caption, shared by the three callers phase 20
 * gave one brush. Buttons rather than a gesture, because phase 19
 * already spent the drag on selecting a period and §13.3 refuses to
 * conflate the two: a reader who wants to look closer at March must
 * not be made to filter the tab to March to do it. The wheel was
 * rejected for trapping the page under the reader's pointer, and the
 * double-click for colliding with the click that clears the brush.
 *
 * Rendered hidden, for the reason the brush is (§11.2): without the
 * script these buttons frame a chart they cannot move.
 *
 * `reset` is not a fifth step so much as the way back — it is the one
 * button whose target does not depend on where the reader is.
 *
 * @var array $grain Per-unit wording for what a bar is worth
 * @var string $zoomLabel Names the group for a screen reader
 * @var string $zoomAway What to say when the selection is off screen
 * @var string $zoomSelection Names the look-inside-the-selection step,
 *     and its presence is what offers that step at all
 * @var string $zoomNote Optional sentence under the buttons
