 * column and no mass-action toolbar. It drew twenty-five rows at the
 * event badge's height until then, which measured 792px against an
 * Overview whose whole left column was 1531px: a summary that had to be
 * scrolled past, in a card that scrolled internally to hold it. What
 * those rows were being read for — *who reports this, and when* — is
 * answered in one strip by `value_reporting` beneath, and the rest is
 * one *Open full table* away.
