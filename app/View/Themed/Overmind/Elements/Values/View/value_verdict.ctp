/**
 * The Assessment tab for a value whose signals agree.
 *
 * Agreeing, not threatening: a value everything points away from is the
 * same kind of argument as one everything points at, made in the same
 * shape, and it earns the same layout. What changes between a `threat`
 * lean and a `benign` one is the colour, the glyph, and whether there
 * is a warninglist band — none of which is a reason for a second
 * template. Only `contested` gets one, because two irreconcilable cases
 * genuinely do not fit a single ledger.
 *
 * One card, not four. The lean, its provenance, the listing that drives
 * it where there is one, the signals behind it and the contradictions
 * that survived are a single argument, and separate cards made the
 * reader reassemble it. They are bands of one card here, in the order
 * the argument is made.
 *
 * `Who says what` stays its own card — the same argument counted a
 * different way, by organisation rather than by signal.
 *
 * The arithmetic, the trend, the exclusions and what would falsify the
 * assessment live in the rail, from `value_verdict_aside`.
 *
 * Lazily loaded into `.ajax-tab-content` from
 * ValuesController::viewVerdict.
 *
 * @var array $valueProfile
