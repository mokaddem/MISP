/**
 * The tug-bar — how many opinions fall each way.
 *
 * One stacked bar sized by *how many opinions fall each side of 50*,
 * with what it amounts to stated beside it in words. It answers "is
 * this set divided, and how lopsided" before the reader looks at a
 * single row, which is why it opens the Collaboration tab's standing
 * panel and why phase 35 brought it to the Overview.
 *
 * **Extracted from `value_analyst_standing` rather than copied.** Two
 * renderings of one encoding is exactly how the histogram this panel
 * deleted came to paint the axis the opposite way round from the table
 * beside it (`26-analyst.md` §6). One element cannot disagree with
 * itself, and the two callers hand it the same array from the same
 * union: `analystContext` builds `standing` once and both
 * `forAnalystStanding` and `forAnalystPreview` return it.
 *
 * **Sized by headcount, and it says so under itself.** The caption is
 * not decoration. On the standing panel the bar sits above a 0-100
 * score axis and a one-against-three split would otherwise put a
 * segment boundary at 25% of a scale it has nothing to do with; on the
 * Overview there is no axis, and the guard is against the plainer
 * misreading that a long green segment means a strong opinion rather
 * than several of them.
 *
 * **`tugLead` carries the denominator where the panel's own header
 * does not.** The standing panel's sub-line already reads *N opinions
 * from M organisations*, so its lead is just *The split*. The
 * Overview's card is headed *2 notes · 4 opinions · 1 proposal*, and
 * those opinions are not this bar's: `analystCounts` counts top-level
 * items of any anchor, `analystStanding` counts opinions at any depth
 * that rate the value. The two can differ in both directions, so the
 * caller that cannot rely on its header states the count in the lead.
 *
 * @var array $tugOrgs One row per opinion on the value — `standing`'s
 *                     `orgs`, from `ValueProfile::analystStanding`
 * @var string $tugLead The subhead over the bar
