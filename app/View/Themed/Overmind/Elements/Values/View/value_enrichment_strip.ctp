/**
 * The promoted widgets: one row, five at most, above the module rows.
 *
 * **The geometry is the decision.** This panel was measured at 179px
 * on a four-module value and ~180px was accepted as the budget for a
 * full-width panel of this kind. A row of five widgets at roughly
 * 190px sits inside that same order of magnitude; a stack of five
 * would be 500–1000px and would make enrichment the tallest thing on
 * the Overview, which is not what an overview is. So the row scrolls
 * sideways before it grows, and each widget clips at 150px.
 *
 * **One widget per shape**, whatever answered. Where three modules all
 * returned a geolocation the renderer merged them and this draws one
 * map; what the other two said is still on the rows below as chips.
 * Five *different* visual answers, never three maps.
 *
 * **A slot with no answer keeps its place in the row.** The order is
 * the profile's request, so a gap in it is information, and closing it
 * up would report four answers to a reader who asked for five and got
 * four. The slot says *not asked*.
 *
 * What it does **not** say is which module to press, and that is not
 * an omission: a slot is a shape, a run is a module, and a mapping
 * between the two is precisely the roster this design refuses to keep.
 * The Enrichment tab is where every module has its own control, so the
 * slot points there rather than guessing.
 *
 * **On a profile that marks nothing `auto`, this row is final on
 * load**, like everything else the Overview draws. Where some modules
 * are still answering it says so and how many, and redraws itself once
 * they have landed — because a widget that changed silently would be a
 * page arguing with what a reader had already read.
 *
 * **What it draws, the rows below do not repeat.** The modules whose
 * whole answer is in this row travel with it, because the browser
 * reads them off the redraw: a module that fired on arrival has a
 * chip row until its answer lands, and the strip that comes back is
 * what says the row has been taken over.
 *
 * @var array $strip From the panel's `strip`
 * @var string $valueB64
