/**
 * What analysts typed into the `comment` column of this value's
 * occurrences.
 *
 * **The one panel on this tab whose subject is the value itself.**
 * Every other item here is anchored to a uuid — a note on an event, an
 * opinion on a note, a report on an event — and each spends a chip
 * saying which, because analyst data cannot address a value. A comment
 * is a column on the occurrence, so the sentence *somebody wrote this
 * about this value* needs no qualification for once. It is also by far
 * the most common analyst writing MISP holds: 2.1M attributes on this
 * instance carry a comment, against 75 notes and 43 opinions.
 *
 * **A table, and one row per distinct sentence.** `94.98.224.81` carries
 * *Xtreme RAT botnet C2 server (confidence level: 100%)* on 1,459
 * occurrences — one thing somebody wrote, stamped onto every row by a
 * feed. A row per occurrence would have been 1,459 identical lines; the
 * count belongs in a column, and it is the most interesting thing on
 * the row.
 *
 * **Three things the panel refuses to imply:**
 *
 * - **Who wrote it.** A comment has no author. Its only attribution is
 *   the creating organisation of the event its attribute sits in, and
 *   the column says *Event's org* rather than *Author*.
 * - **When it was written.** Its only date is `attributes.timestamp`,
 *   a row write that any later edit to any other column moves. The
 *   column says *Row last written*.
 * - **That two spellings are one sentence.** `attributes.comment` is
 *   `utf8mb3_bin`, the grouping is byte-exact, and `Blocked` and
 *   `blocked` are two rows here.
 *
 * Lazily loaded into `.ajax-tab-content` from
 * ValuesController::viewAnalystComments.
