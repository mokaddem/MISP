/**
 * The Timeline tab — candidate `T-final`.
 *
 * One window, three depths. The spine says *when* the value was busy,
 * the source lanes say *which sources say so*, and the chronology says
 * *what exactly happened* — and all three are the same selection, which
 * is the whole design. Each of the four candidates the deck opened with
 * answered one of those three questions and lost the other two.
 *
 * The tab's placeholder note promised a merged chronology of seven
 * sources. Of those seven, one is fully dated and addressable by value,
 * one needs an assembled union, two are truncated to first-and-last,
 * one is a nullable per-occurrence span, and two carry no timestamp in
 * MISP on any instance. So the design problem was never how to draw a
 * chronology — it was how to draw one that admits its own holes without
 * becoming unreadable. Every hatched lane and every precision chip
 * below is that admission, put in the reading path rather than in a
 * margin a reader can skip.
 *
 * Three cards in one panel, and one endpoint behind them, because the
 * brush is a single control driving two regions that must already exist
 * when it fires (`06-timeline.md` §4).
 *
 * The spine is Chart.js, per `00-shared.md` §7. The lanes are inline
 * SVG and deliberately not: a lane has no axis of its own, no legend
 * and no scale, so seven Chart.js instances would be seven canvases for
 * a shape that needs marks and a `<title>`.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewTimeline.

 * A value first seen last week needs finer bins and one held since 2020
 * needs coarser, so the rule is the range's — and it is this tab's own
 * rule rather than `ValueProfileBuckets`' default, because a bar here
 * means something different from a bar on the Sightings navigator. A
 * sighting has a timestamp to the second; a bar here is a density over
 * sources MISP dates unevenly, so the finest grain it offers is a day
 * and it reaches for it only when the whole range is short enough that
 * a day is what the reader is asking about.
 *
 * Deliberately not `plan()`. That ships every grain and lets the
 * browser re-aggregate, which is right for a chart with one series and
 * wrong here: this spine is stacked per source, so a grain is a matrix
 * rather than a row, and the counts it stacks are already server-side.
