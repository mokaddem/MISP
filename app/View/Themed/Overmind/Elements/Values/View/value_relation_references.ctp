/**
 * Section six: MISP's own typed relation between two objects.
 *
 * The other five notions on this tab are derived — a shared event, a
 * shared object, a CIDR containment, a feed cache hit. This one and the
 * asserted claims are the two somebody **wrote**, and they are written
 * about different things: a claim is an analyst's statement about a
 * value, and a reference is a structural fact about an object. Keeping
 * them in separate sections is §5's separation applied to the two human
 * notions rather than only to the machine ones.
 *
 * Three things this section is careful about:
 *
 *   both depths       a reference can point at this value's own
 *                     attribute, or at the object it sits in. Reading
 *                     only the second would miss the case that carries
 *                     `24-relationships.md` §25.3's bridge, where ten
 *                     `hosted-by` references point at one bare address.
 *   both directions   `hosted-by` reads one way and the row says which.
 *                     An inbound reference is somebody else's object
 *                     naming this value; an outbound one is this
 *                     value's object naming something else.
 *   self is not a     `18.117.184.102` sits in four `passive-dns`
 *   relation          objects and each carries a `hosted-by` back to
 *                     the bare attribute. Those are the value pointing
 *                     at itself and they are dropped — they would have
 *                     been eight of twelve rows.
 *
 * The relationship type is printed **verbatim**. `hosted-by` and
 * `communicates-with` are MISP's own vocabulary; `Crush` and `Co-worker`
 * are on the verification instance because somebody typed them, and a
 * panel that normalised those would be hiding what the data says.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewRelationReferences.
