/**
 * The rail's second card: what MISP is configured to count.
 *
 * Every number on this tab is conditional on rules the reader cannot see
 * from the page, and a count whose rules are invisible is a count nobody
 * should trust. This card is where those rules are written down — which
 * is also why it is the one panel on the tab that still renders for a
 * value with nothing at all: what MISP counts is true whether or not
 * this value has anything to count.
 *
 * **A rule earns a row by bounding a number below it that nothing else
 * on the page states.** Two do, and both are the feed cache's: how many
 * sources have caching switched on and how many events are listed per
 * source. Everything else was dropped over three passes.
 *
 * The correlation limit and the exclusion list went first: no section
 * on this tab reads `default_correlations`, so neither bounds a number
 * here. They are named only when this value is on the wrong side of
 * one — see `$alerts`. The ssdeep threshold went next, for the
 * opposite reason: it does bound the near-match count, and that panel
 * already prints it *with* what it did — *"M pairs cleared the
 * threshold of 40"* — so the rail's shorter telling taught less than
 * the one two columns over.
 *
 * **And three sections answer to no setting at all**: the two object
 * joins and the typed references read attributes and
 * `object_references` directly. A card that lists what governs this
 * tab has to say where nothing does, which is the `†` under the
 * breakdown.
 *
 * **A settings value is not a finding.** The card printed five
 * mechanisms as bordered `.vp-fact-line` boxes and measured 1,278px
 * against a rail whose other two panels are 380px and 427px. Prose is
 * spent on the exceptions now — a value past the correlation limit, a
 * value in `correlation_exclusions`, an instance with nothing cached —
 * because those are the readings that change what the reader does.
 *
 * **Nothing explains a mechanism here any more.** A fold held those
 * paragraphs for one pass; every one of them turned out to be a
 * shorter retelling of something the panel that owns the rule already
 * says in context — the md5-membership caveat is the external panel's
 * opening line, the threshold is the near-match caption, and the `†`
 * note restates itself two lines below. A rail card is the wrong place
 * to explain a section that is on the same screen.
 *
 * The breakdown at the foot is the tab's arithmetic, stated rather than
 * left to be inferred. **Eight notions and five units** — values,
 * relations, remote events, references, claims — so each row names its
 * own unit and nothing is summed into one strength.
 *
 * **This is still the only panel on the page that reads the correlation
 * engine's state live.** Section one is an event join, section two
 * re-derives its own matches and section four reads a cache; the
 * Overview's correlation card is fixture-built. So what the engine did
 * or refused to do for this value is reported in this card's warn lines
 * or nowhere — which is why they survived the rows.
 * prd/value-profile-live/24-relationships.md §3.

 * and it is a different question from whether the pane beside this one
 * could read the value's events, which is what `suppressed` means
 * since phase 24.
 *
 * Read straight off `relationSettings`, which asks
 * `OverCorrelatingValue` for this value every time this panel is
 * fetched. It used to fall back to the neighbourhood fold's
 * `suppressed` flag, which was the last thing holding this card to a
 * 20,000-row scan — and a fallback for a question the live read always

/*
 * The three readings worth a paragraph on the face of the card, and —
 * for the first two — the only reason the correlation engine is
 * mentioned here at all.
 *
 * **Neither the correlation limit nor the exclusion list bounds a
 * single number on this tab.** `default_correlations` links two
 * attributes carrying the *same* value, so the engine never returns a
 * different one: section one is an event join, section two re-derives
 * CIDR and ssdeep from the engine's own inputs, and the rest read
 * `object_references`, a feed cache or an analyst's claim.
 * `OverCorrelatingValue` and `Correlation::isValueExcluded` are each
 * read in exactly one place in `ValueProfile` — `relationSettings`,
 * for this card — and nothing consults them again. The Occurrences tab
 * is not bounded by them either; it queries `attributes` directly, so
 * a value past the limit still lists every occurrence it has.
 *
 * So they are not rules of this card and no longer get a row. `Limit
 * 20` beside a value nowhere near 20 teaches nothing, and stating it
 * under a heading promising *the settings these sections depend on*
 * teaches something false.
 *
 * They stay as exceptions because *this value is past the limit* is a
 * real fact with real consequences elsewhere in MISP, and this card is
 * the page's only live statement of it: the Overview's correlation
 * card is still fixture-built, and the co-occurrence panel's version
 * is inside its `suppressed` branch, which is a different condition —
 * `0.0.0.0` is past the limit and renders a full neighbourhood table.
 * Each says plainly that the sections beside it are unaffected.
