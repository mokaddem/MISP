 *
 * **Newest first across both kinds**, so a card headed *the most

 *
 * **The event-report count lands here** rather than as a seventh fact
 * cell, which is where `29-overview.md` §10 recommended it and §14.8
 * deferred it: this card already mirrors the tab that holds the list,
 * and the fact strip is full at six. It is a count and never a row —
 * the documents are the tab's third panel.

 * ValuesController::viewAnalystPreview.

 * union behind this card already builds the ledger the tab's standing
 * panel draws, and `forAnalystPreview` used to throw it away.
 *
 * Only the bar comes over, and not the lane ledger under it. The bar
 * is *how many fall each way*, which is a shape a reader takes in
 * without reading anything; the ledger is one lane, one score, one
 * organisation and one date per opinion, which is a table — and the
 * Overview already sent its tables to the tabs that own them.
 *
 * **It is also the only thing on this card that is not capped.** The
 * list under it is the newest four items of any kind, so a value with
 * two notes and six opinions can fill it with notes and show no
 * opinion at all; the bar counts every opinion that rates the value.
 * That is what earns it the ~72px rather than merely the fact that it
 * was free.
 *
 * Absent on a value nobody has rated — which on the verification
 * instance is four values of five. A bar over no opinions would be an
 * empty state inside a card that already has one.
