 * The write, disabled — and the sentence that says what it would do.
 *
 * `Sighting::saveSightings(false, [$value], ...)` matches either side of
 * a composite — the same identity rule `Value::conditionsFor` states —
 * and writes one row per attribute the caller can reach. On a value page
 * that is a fan-out: one click here
 * becomes as many rows as this value has visible occurrences, across
 * however many events and organisations those sit in.
 *
 * A control with that reach has to state it before it is ever enabled,
 * so the count is the one the write would produce: every occurrence of
 * the value this viewer can see, soft-deleted ones included, because
 * `saveSightings` resolves through `fetchAttributesSimple` and that
 * fetcher does not drop them. It is therefore larger than the number of
 * reports the list beside it can show — `Sighting::listSightings` does
 * drop them — and it is the write's number that this card owes.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewSightingAdd.
 *
 * @var array $valueProfile
 * @var string $valueB64

/*
 * Prepared counts when the panel is live, counted from the rows when it

 * fetching them to count three numbers cost 617 ms. `ValueProfileFixture`
 * supplies no `sighting_fanout` and still drives this element from its
 * own occurrence rows, so the guard is what keeps the double honest
