 * produced, while the foot printed directly under it counted the
 * ambiguities, a different quantity entirely; one word over two sources
 * is `10-wiring.md` §7.8, and they retired together in phase 9.
 *
 * `Who says what` stays its own card: it is the same argument counted
 * a different way, by organisation rather than by signal.
