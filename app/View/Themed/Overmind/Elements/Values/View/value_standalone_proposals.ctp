/**
 * The proposals that propose *adding* this value.
 *
 * **`value-profile-coverage.md` §2.2's defect made visible.** A
 * proposal with `old_id = 0` proposes a new attribute rather than a
 * change to an existing one, so nothing in `attributes` holds the value
 * yet and every occurrence read on this page returns nothing for it.
 * `123.123.123.1` is proposed on event 195 and was rendering as §2.12's
 * unknown page; this block is what the tab was missing.
 *
 * **Beside the table and never inside it.** §5.1's counting question
 * has one answer — a proposal is not an attribute row and the header
 * should not say it is — and the table above states *N attribute rows
 * across M events*, counts facets over those rows in the rail, and
 * sorts and pages them in script. Folding these in would have had all
 * three counting a row of a table it is not a row of. Every number the
 * table prints is the number it printed before this block existed.
 *
 * **No distribution badge, and that is not an omission.**
 * `shadow_attributes` has no distribution column: a proposal's audience
 * is exactly its event's, and the event is named and linked on every
 * row here. A badge would restate what the link already leads to.
 *
 * **Withdrawn proposals stay, struck through**, the way phase 26's
 * report list keeps withdrawn reports — somebody wrote it and somebody
 * discarded it, and both are part of what happened to this value.
 *
 * Rendered from `value_occurrence_table.ctp`, off the same
 * `forOccurrenceTable` read, so the block and the table cannot be
 * answering two different fetches.
 *
 * @var array $proposals From `ValueProfile::forOccurrenceTable`
