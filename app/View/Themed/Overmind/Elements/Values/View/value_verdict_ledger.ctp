/**
 * The signal ledger: every row that produced the score, and every row
 * that refused to.
 *
 * A real table rather than a stack of rows, so Signal, Evidence,
 * Contribution and As of line up down the page and a reader can scan
 * one column at a time. A signal links to the tab holding its evidence.
 *
 * Grouped by kind rather than sorted by weight: an analyst checking
 * whether the sightings were counted twice wants them next to each
 * other, not scattered through a ranking.
 *
 * **Every row here weighs the record**, since
 * `review-2026-09-13.md` §D1: ▲ is a row where the record carries
 * something — corroboration, publication, attribution, a datable
 * observation — and ▼ one where it does not. The direction no longer
 * depends on the lean, which is the point: *four organisations
 * reported it* is the same fact about the record whether the record
 * concluded threat or benign, and anchoring it used to render that
 * fact as `−28` **against** a benign reading.
 *
 * The rows that do read the value — the warninglist's hits and
 * false-positive sightings — are not in this table. They are in the
 * lean band above, which is the surface that explains the reading, and
 * keeping them out is what lets this table sum to the quality exactly.
 *
 * Contradictions are a group inside this table rather than a card of
 * their own: they are ledger rows whose contribution is `unresolved`,
 * and lifting them out would imply they had been netted off somewhere.
 *
