 * How the two weights were reached, as a rail card.
 *
 * The arithmetic the agreeing layout shows for its quality, done over
 * the lean ledger instead and folded into two sides that are never
 * added together. Each case gets its own strip and its own total, so
 * the tug-of-war bar in the hero can be checked against the signals
 * that produced it.
 *
 * **The lean rows, not the quality's**, since `review-2026-09-13.md`
 * §A3: splitting the whole ledger by sign seated five absences under
 * a heading claiming they read the value as benign. So this card and
 * the agreeing layout's are no longer the same rows — that one sums
 * to `quality`, this one to `lean_weight`, which is also why the two
 * totals here really are never the quality's difference.
 *
 * Grouped by signal group rather than listed per signal: at rail
 * width a signal's own wording does not fit, and "what kind of
 * evidence is carrying this case" is the question the breakdown
 * answers anyway.
 *
 * Derived from the cases rather than carried separately, so this card
 * and the two columns beside it cannot disagree.
