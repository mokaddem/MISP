 * The strip's scale
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **A tick at every January**, which is the only gridline a strip of
 * months has that is not arbitrary. The strip carried its first and
 * last month and nothing between, so a bar four fifths of the way along
 * a nine-year span could be read as *recent* and no more precisely than
 * that.
 *
 * **The scale is a row of the bars' own geometry, not a set of
 * percentages.** `.vp-spark-bar` is `flex: 1 1 0` with a `max-width`,
 * so on a short span the bars stop growing and bunch at the left — and
 * a tick placed at `i / n` of the width would then sit nowhere near the
 * bar it names. One empty slot per month, sharing the bars' flex rules,
 * puts every tick on its own bar whatever the cap does.
 *
 * **Thinned rather than crowded.** `0.0.0.0` spans 128 months, which is
 * eleven Januaries over ~560px; every year labelled would be four-digit
 * labels ~50px apart. The marks stay annual — the gridline is the
 * point — and one label in `$tickStep` carries the year.
 *
 * A tick in the last two months of the span draws its mark and keeps
 * its label, which would otherwise hang off the right edge of the card.

 * **The chip wears MISP's IDS shield, and MISP's IDS colours with it.**
 *
 * The glyph is `fa-shield-halved`, which is what
 * `Fields/ids` draws in the occurrence table two cards above this one —
 * so the chip says *which flag* it is a reading of rather than leaving
 * the reader to infer it from the word alone.
 *
 * That forced the palette. `yes` was drawn in the attribute green until
 * the shield arrived, and a green shield here beside an **amber** one
 * up there is one fact in two colours on one tab. Amber is *IDS
 * active*, grey is *IDS inactive*, and this card now says the same
 * thing in the same colours as the table it summarises.
 *
 * `mixed` keeps amber and takes a **dashed** edge rather than a third
 * hue — the rule the relevance chip already follows, direction in the
 * geometry. An organisation with the value twice, actionable once, has
 * not made half a decision; it has made none, and a shade between two
 * colours would say it made half.
 *
 * `none` is unreachable and is kept as a guard: `orgStanceFor` counts
 * every one of an organisation's non-deleted rows into `to_ids_yes` or
 * `to_ids_no`, and a row exists for that organisation or it would not
