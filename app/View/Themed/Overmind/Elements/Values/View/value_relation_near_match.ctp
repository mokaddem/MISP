 * Section two: values that are close to this one without being it.
 *
 * The sentence this whole section exists to prevent a reader from
 * assuming is *these two values are the same*. They are not, and the
 * panel says so above the rows rather than trusting a dashed border to
 * carry the argument.
 *
 * Four engine states appear here and all four are different:
 *
 *   active           the engine runs for this type and found rows.
 *   cannot run       MISP ships the engine and it applies to this
 *                    value, but the extension behind it is not loaded
 *                    here. A fact about the instance, not the value,
 *                    and the only one of the four somebody can fix.
 *   not applicable   the engine exists and runs, but not on a value of
 *                    this type. Nothing is missing, nothing is hidden.
 *   no engine        MISP has no such engine at all. Not empty, not
 *                    inapplicable — absent, and still named so the gap
 *                    is visible rather than quietly dropped.
 *
 * The first two get a block, because each has something to report. The
 * last two are one fact apiece and get one line apiece — see
 * `$engineLine`. Before that they spent ~310px of a ~760px section
 * explaining, at length, that they had done nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a provenance column, because there is none: the
 * correlation table stores `value`, two event ids, two attribute ids,
 * org and distribution, and exact matches and CIDR containment are
 * written into it together. Every row below is re-derived at render
 * time, and says so.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewRelationNearMatch.

             * registrable-domain or public-suffix relation: no

             * template, about why a gap in the brief is drawn instead
             * of quietly dropped. That argument belongs here, in the
             * source, and not on a page an analyst is trying to read
             * past: at ~217px it cost more of the section than the
             * engine that actually ran.
             *
             * Still deliberately unlike *not applicable* above it —
             * that engine exists and declines this type, this one does
             * not exist — which is why the state column says so in its
             * own words rather than reusing the label.
             *
             * **B10 did not replace this call**, which is what
             * `24b-relationships.md` §12 planned. §12.1 priced the

             * parent-domain lookup at 10–51 ms that MISP genuinely has
             * no code path for, and a child lookup at 4,533 ms — worst
             * when it finds nothing, which is 96 domain values in 100 —
             * that only a schema change makes affordable. Generating
             * spellings does not make a parent-domain relation exist,
             * so the typosquat engine sits above this line instead of
             * on top of it, and the gap stays drawn.
