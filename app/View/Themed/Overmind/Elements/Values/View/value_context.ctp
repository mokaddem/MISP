/**
 * What the community has labelled this value.
 *
 * Tags are grouped by taxonomy rather than listed flat, because a
 * taxonomy is the unit that can disagree with itself: two events putting
 * `tlp:amber` and `tlp:green` on the same value is a fact about the
 * value, and a flat list hides it. Where a taxonomy is ordinal —
 * `admiralty-scale` and its kin — the group renders as a position on a
 * scale instead of a string nobody reads.
 *
 * **One list over both scopes.** A label reaches this card from the
 * value's occurrences or from the events those occurrences sit in, and
 * the two are drawn together: an attribute is covered by its event's
 * labelling, so *tagged on the report* and *tagged on the indicator*
 * are one statement about the value made at two removes. They were two
 * sections with a glyph telling them apart for one day; what that
 * bought was a heading and half the card's height separating a long
 * list from a usually empty one, since most attributes carry no tag of
 * their own.
 *
 * **No `×N` beside a chip, and that is the fold's price.** The
 * occurrence scope counts occurrences and the event scope counts
 * events; their union is a third number neither read holds and buying
 * it costs a second pass over the value's `attribute_tags`. So each
 * chip's title states whichever counts it has, under their own names,
 * and the page keeps its rule that every `×N` on it counts one thing.
 * `ValueProfile::mergeTagScopes` carries both.
 *
 * **Clusters are grouped under their galaxy**, which is the thing they
 * are members of. Flat, the card put a tool, a threat actor and four
 * ATT&CK techniques in one run with each chip repeating its own kind in
 * small print; the galaxy is what they have in common, so it heads them
 * and is said once.
 *
 * Lazily loaded into `.ajax-tab-content` from
 * ValuesController::viewContext.

/**
 * A row per taxonomy, or the taxonomies flowed into one band.
 *
 * **A height budget, and the number is measured.** A taxonomy row costs
 * 49px whether it holds one chip or ten, and folding the events' labels
 * in takes `8.8.8.8` from three taxonomies to ten — six of them a
 * single chip. A row each was 518px of a card the Overview holds at
 * 534, nearly all of it the white space to the right of a one-chip
 * group in a 1,000px card.
 *
 * Flowed, the same ten groups are 170px and **keep their names**: each
 * is its taxonomy's label and then its chips, wrapping as one unit, so
 * what is given up is the column alignment rather than the grouping.
 * What a row does buy is the ordinal scale, which needs the width — so
 * five, the point at which a value's taxonomies stop fitting as rows,
 * and below it the card draws exactly what it drew before it had two
 * scopes to fold.
 *
 * No scale is drawn in the flowed band, and on a value this broadly
 * labelled there would be none to draw in any case: a position means
 * *one tag of this dimension*, and `8.8.8.8` carries `tlp:white`,
 * `tlp:amber` and `tlp:red` from three different reports.
