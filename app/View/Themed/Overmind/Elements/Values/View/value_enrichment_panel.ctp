 * The Overview's enrichment panel: what the modules have said about

 *
 * **The Overview refused anything from Enrichment for three phases**,
 * and the refusal was right on its own terms: that tab was the one
 * that read nothing from the database, so there was nothing to borrow
 * that was not a network request, and this tab renders eight panels
 * whether or not a module is up. `value_enrichment_runs` is what
 * changed — a module's last answer is now an indexed read of one
 * table, so this paints at the speed of a database read and the
 * queries, where there are any, happen after it has painted.
 *
 * **It is not emitted at all when there is nothing to show.** The page
 * frame decides that before it emits a container, so an instance that
 * has never enriched anything and declares no `auto` module has an
 * Overview identical to the one it had before this existed. The
 * panel's presence is itself the signal that something is known.
 *
 * **A summary and not the tab.** Three chips a module, a `+N` for what
 * that leaves out, and a count where the answer is a set — the shape
 * rule is `ValueEnrichmentTool::chipsFor` and it keys on the shape of
 * the response rather than on which module produced it. The real
 * per-type visualisations — a map for an IP's geolocation, and
 * whatever the equivalent is per type — are a later design, and these
 * chips are the placeholder they replace.
 *
 * When, never who: naming the analyst who ran a module would tell
 * the organisation which colleague is looking at which value.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewEnrichmentPanel.
