/**
 * The clock band — relevance, at the rank the other two axes have.
 *
 * D11's three axes were not three on this tab. Lean carried its badge,
 * the escalation that decided it and a table of who says what; quality
 * carried the number, the band and a ledger whose rows sum to it
 * exactly. Relevance carried one clause of the hero's sentence and a
 * 90-day line in the rail — a reader could see *what* the axis
 * concluded and nothing of *why*, on the one axis whose inputs are
 * dates a reader can go and check.
 *
 * **A band rather than a card, and rather than a number in the hero.**
 * D11 §7 rules out the obvious fix: three competing numbers at the top
 * is what the one-number verdict was replaced for, and `summary`
 * already composes the three axes in a sentence. What was missing is
 * the axis's working, and the argument card is where this tab keeps
 * working — the warninglist band and the ledger are its neighbours, in
 * the order the argument is made.
 *
 * It costs no query. `$verdict['relevance']` is built inside
 * `ValueVerdictTool::assess()` from the context the quality already
 * read, so every fact drawn here was on the tab before this band
 * existed and was being thrown away at render.
 *
 * The facts and the corroboration list are the Lifetime card's own
 * elements, not copies of them. `10-wiring.md` §14.3 is why: this tab
 * drew *expired, 33 days over* while the Sightings tab drew *64 days
 * left* for one value on one page, and two panels computing one
 * quantity twice is a defect this corpus has now shipped three times.
 * A shared element cannot disagree with itself.
 *
 * @var array $verdict The assessment, carrying `relevance`

/*
 * The one value this band has nothing to add to: a record the viewer
 * holds nothing of. `no_record` is `clock.at === null`, which is the
 * same condition the lean's first rule reads to return `none`, so the
 * hero has already said *nothing you can see records this value* and a
 * band repeating it in the clock's words is a second empty state under
 * the first. Every other silence is drawn, because every other silence
 * is about this axis rather than about the whole record.
 *
 * The Lifetime card keeps its own no-record state: it is the panel a
 * reader opens *for* the clock, and it is the only thing on that panel.
