/**
 * The two things a reader can ask of the assessment, neither of which
 * is built yet.
 *
 * **They used to sit in the hero**, top right, at the same visual
 * weight as the lean badge and the quality gauge — two disabled
 * buttons holding the most valuable corner of the card and doing
 * nothing with it. Four objects competed there and the eye had no
 * entry point. They are the small print of the card, so they are in
 * the small print: the provenance strip already runs a quarter empty
 * on every value, and *where the number came from* and *what you can
 * do with it* are the same kind of fact.
 *
 * They stay drawn rather than hidden, which is the opposite of D23's
 * call for the editor — and for the opposite reason. D23 removed an
 * inert *control*: a state an analyst could reach for and believe they
 * had set. These set nothing and claim nothing, and both say in a
 * tooltip which phase brings them. If that judgement goes the other
 * way, this element is the one file to delete.
