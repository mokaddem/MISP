/**
 * The chrome of the panels an endpoint is about to deliver, drawn
 * before it answers.
 *
 * **Why the page draws them at all.** Every panel here is lazily
 * loaded, and the container each one lands in used to hold nothing but
 * a centred spinner — ~84px whatever was coming. So a tab opened as a
 * column of anonymous boxes and grew to its real height panel by panel
 * as the fetches came back: a reader could not tell which section was
 * which, could not reach the one they came for, and watched the page
 * move under the cursor for as long as the slowest endpoint took.
 *
 * `value_panel_placeholder` makes the same move for a panel that is not
 * written yet; this one is for a panel that is merely not here yet.
 *
 * **The layout, the shimmer and the row split are not this file's.**
 * `genericElementsBS5/Layout/ajax_card_skeleton` owns them and any page
 * in the theme can use it. What is left here is the only part that is
 * this page's: the chrome. A panel skeleton wears `value_panel_header`
 * itself, so the glyph tile, the title baseline and the 36px they sit
 * on do not move when the fetch lands, and a rail skeleton wears the
 * `vp-aside-head` strip the rail cards wear.
 *
 * **A skeleton names only what the endpoint will certainly render.**
 * The Verdict rail is four cards or five depending on the disposition,
 * and each one's title with it — a title guessed wrong is worse than no
 * title, so those entries pass `title => null` and get a shimmer where
 * the words will be. Only the rail's lighter chrome takes a null:
 * `value_panel_header` escapes and prints the title it is given, and
 * teaching it to hold markup for one caller would change the element
 * twenty-odd panels share.
 *
 * @var array $panels One descriptor per card:
 *                    `title`  string, or null on an `aside`
 *                    `icon`   Font Awesome class or misp-icon triplet
 *                    `color`  CSS colour for the glyph tile
 *                    `lines`  how many body lines to shimmer, default 3
 *                    `shape`  `panel` (default) or `aside`, the lighter
 *                             chrome the rail cards wear
 *                    `col`    Bootstrap lg width; when any entry
 *                             carries one the set is laid out as a row,
 *                             which is what the endpoints that own
 *                             their own split need
