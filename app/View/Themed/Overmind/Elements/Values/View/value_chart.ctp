<?php
/**
 * One Chart.js canvas, themed from CSS rather than from literals.
 *
 * Callers write colours as `var(--something)` in the config exactly as
 * they would in a stylesheet; `VP.chart` resolves them against the
 * canvas at init, so a chart picks up the same variables the rest of
 * the page does, and resolves them again when `data-bs-theme` flips —
 * the only way a canvas can follow a theme it cannot inherit.
 *
 * This element is the shape for a chart that is fully described by its
 * config. The Sightings overlay is not — it swaps datasets as the
 * reader changes range — so it drives `VP.chart` itself rather than
 * being handed a config here.
 *
 * Safe inside a lazily-injected fragment: `loadAjaxContainer` re-creates
 * every `<script>` after setting innerHTML, so the canvas exists by the
 * time this runs, and the Chart global is polled for rather than
 * assumed — `Chart.min` is loaded once at page level.
 *
 * @var string $chartId     Namespaced per panel, so two cards cannot
 *                          collide over one canvas
 * @var array $chartConfig  A Chart.js config
 * @var int $chartHeight    Fixed, because a canvas in a flex column
 *                          with no height resizes forever
 * @var string $chartLabel  Accessible name for the canvas
 * @var array $chartLegendSkip Dataset labels to keep off the legend,
 *                          for a series that is scaffolding rather than
 *                          a reading of its own — a threshold line. The
 *                          series is still drawn and still in tooltips.
