/**
 * Section four: where this value sits in somebody else's events.
 *
 * The fourth notion of "related" on this tab, and the only one whose
 * rows are not on this instance. A MISP-format feed or a cached sync
 * server holds the value inside a remote event, and that event can be
 * named and opened — co-occurrence outside the instance boundary, which
 * nothing else on this page can see past.
 *
 * Three things this section is careful about:
 *
 *   the count matches   a source that holds the value but publishes no
 *                       event still gets a row, marked as such. Drop
 *                       those and the Overview card's number stops
 *                       matching the rows here, which makes a reader
 *                       distrust both.
 *   the notice is role  "your role cannot see this" is keyed on the
 *                       reader and shown on every value alike, never on
 *                       whether this value hit something withheld. A
 *                       notice that appeared only when something was
 *                       hidden would be an existence oracle at one bit
 *                       (`live/00-contract.md` §14.6).
 *   the link leaves     opening a remote event previews it from the
 *                       feed or server at request time. It is the only
 *                       affordance on this page that is not a local
 *                       read, so it says so — and it says *preview*
 *                       rather than *fetch*, because a MISP reader hears
 *                       "fetch" as pulling the event into this instance,
 *                       which is precisely what previewEvent does not
 *                       do.
 *
 * **Counts lead and the UUIDs fold** (subphase B3). A row's headline is
 * how much presence the source holds; the event pills are a wall of
 * UUIDs, which is a click target rather than information, so they sit
 * behind the row's own expander. `<details>` rather than the ledger's
 * Bootstrap collapse because this fragment is injected lazily and binds
 * no JS of its own — a fold that needs `misp:container-loaded` to have
 * fired is a fold that can arrive inert.
 *
 * **Absence is the finding, and it is scoped to who asked.** A value in
 * no cached source is locally novel, which is among the strongest triage
 * facts this page can state — so the miss state states it, with the
 * denominator attached. The denominator is the sources *this reader's
 * role searched*, never the instance's total: "0 of 5" when four of the
 * five were never looked in reads as coverage the reader did not get.
 * And a reader whose role reaches no source at all is told that nothing
 * was looked up, rather than being handed a novelty claim no search
 * backs — the same sentence would be false for them on every value.
 *
 * The Overview's `value_external` card counts what this section lists,
 * through one `forExternal` (`tabs/03-relationships.md` §20.1), and its
 * miss state reads *"Not seen outside this instance"*. This section's
 * novelty sentence is that sentence with the denominator attached; if
 * the wording moves it moves in both.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewRelationExternal.
