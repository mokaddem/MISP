/**
 * The Enrichment tab: every module this value could be sent to, and
 * one module's answer beside it.
 *
 * **The tab has a memory since phase 11.** `value_enrichment_runs`
 * records what a module last said about a value, per organisation, so
 * a row can read *Asked 2 hours ago* and its pane can show that answer
 * without asking anybody anything. The reuse window a profile always
 * declared finally governs something (`13-auto-run.md` §4–5, D25).
 *
 * It says when, never who (D27).
 *
 * The delta against a previous run and the dismissal are still gone —
 * those were phase 12's and `28-enrichment.md` §5 is the list of what
 * came out.
 *
 * What survives is the reason `E2` was chosen: the module is the
 * navigation, and every state the tab can be in is the same object — a
 * rail row. Not asked, asked before, being asked, asking, answered,
 * answered with nothing, refused and errored are eight rows and one
 * pane.
 *
 * **Selecting a row still runs nothing**, and every module's pane is
 * still rendered up front, which is what makes picking one to read
 * incapable of querying anything.
 *
 * **What can now happen on arrival is the profile's and the
 * administrator's, together.** A module a profile marked `auto` fires
 * when this panel loads, but only where
 * `Plugin.ValueProfile_enrichment_auto_run` allows it — off by
 * default, so this panel behaves exactly as it did until somebody
 * turns it on. The plan rides in on `data-vp-e-auto` and is empty
 * otherwise.
 *
 * Lazily loaded from ValuesController::viewEnrichment.
