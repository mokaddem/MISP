 * row of five widgets inside 200px; five tile-fetching maps in it
 * would be five map instances, five sets of network requests and five
 * scripts, on a panel whose whole argument is that it paints at the
 * speed of a database read. The real map is the full rendering on the
 * Enrichment pane, where there is one of it and room for it.
 *
 * So this draws a world outline and the points on it, from geometry
 * that ships as markup. It is a map in the sense that it says *where*,
 * and it says so with no request at all — which is also why it does
 * not change when the instance has tiles turned off.
 *
 * Pure: everything drawn comes from `prepare()`.
