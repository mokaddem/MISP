 * What this name resolved to, as a shape over time or as a set.
 *
 * **Two widgets in one file, and the split is the data's.** A dated
 * answer gets a month-by-month strip of how many resolutions were
 * current; an undated one gets the addresses themselves with a count.
 * Drawing a strip for an undated answer would assert a history nobody
 * observed, and refusing to draw it at all would throw away the only
 * resolution answer a stock instance has.
 *
 * The strip is built from `months`, which `prepare()` computed and
 * filled — this template does no arithmetic beyond turning a count
 * into a percentage of the peak, which is drawing rather than
 * deciding.
