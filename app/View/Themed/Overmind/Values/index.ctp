/**
 * `/values/index` — the way in to the Value Profile.
 *
 * **Not an index of values, and it cannot be one.** The subject of
 * this feature is a value string rather than a row, so *all values* is
 * a `GROUP BY value1` over 3.9M attribute rows — 2M distinct — that no
 * `LIMIT` bounds (`value-index.md` §1.1). Every block on this page
 * therefore either takes its values from the reader or reads a table
 * that is genuinely value-keyed.
 *
 * The page's shape is `value-index/02b-proposal-c.html` as picked in
 * `02a-contract.md` §12 — the worklist, with A's prompt. Phase 3 wires
 * the prompt and the resolver's answers, phase 4 the rows a paste
 * becomes, phase 6 the carried-over line, phase 7 the conditions
 * strip, phase 8 the method note and phase 9 the enrichment store's
 * two numbers. The blocks that have nothing to say are absent rather
 * than drawn empty.
 *
 * **The strip is above the box and the carried-over line below it.**
 * What the strip says — whose thresholds decide the assessments —
 * is true of every answer the box will give, so a reader meets it
 * before the first one rather than after.
 *
 * **One region below the prompt, and it has one occupant.** The
 * invitation, an answer and the worklist are three things to say about
 * the same box and never two at once, so they share a container the
 * page's script can refill from `ValuesController::triage()` without
 * the paste above it moving. The clear control refills the same
 * container from the template below it, which is why the invitation
 * is an element: it is the region's empty state and the thing clear
 * puts back.
 *
 * **The tiles come before the card, not inside it.** They are
 * standing facts about the reader's own situation — what weighs a
 * record, where the bands sit, how much is checked and enriched — and
 * they are read once on arrival and not again. That makes them part of
 * the page's introduction rather than part of the box: a reader who
 * already knows them scrolls past a row, while the same facts inside
 * the card would sit between the header and the control the page
 * exists for.
 *
 * The conditions strip stays inside the card, because what it says is
 * a rule every answer the box gives was worked under.
 *
 * **The carried-over line sits outside that region**, at the foot of
 * the card, because it is the one block on the page that is not about
 * the box: a reader who pastes a list has not stopped being the reader
 * who opened something an hour ago, and a strip the script wiped on
 * every submission would be a way back that disappears the moment it
 * is wanted.
 *
 * @var array|null $resolution What `ValuesController::resolve()` made
 *                             of the box, or null on a plain load
 * @var array|null $triage The rows a pasted list became, or null
 * @var array $recent The values this reader last opened, newest first
 * @var array|null $inForce The Analyst Profile deciding this reader's
 *                          assessments, or null when none is
 * @var array $tiles The tile row's five facts, `weighs`, `bands` and
 *                   `modules` null when no profile is in force
