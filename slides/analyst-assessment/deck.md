**MISP · Value Profile**

# The Analyst Assessment

What MISP makes of a value, and whose judgement that is.

---

**The problem**

## The record does not add itself up

Eight organisations reported this IP. It carries 53 sightings, four of them filed as false positives. It hits a warninglist. No galaxy is attached to it.

So is it a threat?

Every analyst does this arithmetic in their head. No two of them do it the same way.

> Four independent organisations reported it is worth +28 to one analyst and +12 to another, and neither is wrong. — Why MISP could not simply ship weights

> An engine with the weights baked in would be a hidden editorial position shipped as arithmetic.

---

**The move**

MISP owns the arithmetic.
You own the weights it runs on.

> Today, two analysts who read the same value differently have nowhere to put the disagreement. One of them writes a note. A profile turns it into something the system holds: the same evidence, two profiles, two scores, and a ledger each showing which row diverged.

---

**What an assessment is**

## An assessment is three readings

![Three cards: lean contested, relevance current, quality 57](img/three-readings.png)

| Axis | The question it answers | Rendered as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lean** | What does the record assert this value is? | `threat` · `benign` · `contested` · `none` |
| **Relevance** | Does that assertion still matter today? | `current` · `aging` · `expired` · `timeline uncertain` |
| **Quality** | How much can the record be trusted? | a number, with the ledger as its audit trail |

---

**Axis one**

## Lean: what the record asserts

`to_ids` is a per-occurrence vote that a value is an actionable indicator. It is already in the database, and IDS exports already filter on it.

So the lean reports what the community said about the value, and MISP is never asked to form an opinion of its own.

Lean is categorical, and it does not age. A malware hash leans `threat` forever. Only new assertions can move it.

| Lean | When |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | no occurrences |
| `threat` | threat assertions dominate |
| `benign` | no threat assertion, or false-positive evidence dominates, or a `false_positive` warninglist hit carries it |
| `contested` | a conflict rule fires, or the `to_ids` stance splits beyond tolerance |

> `to_ids` is noisy in practice: MISP sets per-type defaults, feed imports set it wholesale, and plenty of organisations never curate it. Splitting the axes is what absorbs that. Lean reports the assertion; quality grades how well it was made. One uncurated org's `to_ids = 1` is a threat lean with low quality. Four organisations deliberately confirming is the same lean with high quality.

---

**Axis two**

## Relevance: whether it still holds

![How long this reading holds: current, 60 days left](img/clock.png)

*The per-type TTL, the last-independent-corroboration clock, expiry and the runway all live on this axis. None of them touches the lean.*

Fresh corroboration makes the reading more current and expiry makes it less. The page lists which corroborations reset the clock, with dates and the organisation that filed each.

Temporal precision feeds in here too. A missing `first_seen`, a long created-to-published lag, or a timestamp standing in for an observation date will each degrade relevance to `timeline uncertain` and deduct from quality.

---

**Axis three**

## Quality: how well evidenced

![How 57 was reached: Reporting +30, Sightings +24, Lifecycle +16, signals against -13, total 57 of 100](img/how-reached.png)

Contributions sum to the score, exactly.

Nothing is normalised, calibrated or post-processed. The sum is the number, by construction, so there is no second code path that could ever disagree with the ledger.

That is what makes a profile diff renderable, and what lets a reader argue with a single row.

The claim it makes is a narrow one. It measures how much corroborated, attributed, temporally precise weight stands behind the record, which is a different question from how malicious the value is.

---

**A real value · this instance, today**

## 8.8.8.8

![Contested. Quality medium, 57 of 100. Analyst profile Incident Response & Investigation. Conflict rule: a warninglist marks this as a false positive and 8 of 8 organisations report it as a threat regardless.](img/hero-contested.png)

*The banner names the reading, the number, the band and the profile that weighted them. On this value it also names the rule that decided the reading.*

> “Both judgements are deliberate; the page will not pick one.” A warninglist standing against eight reporting organisations is the finding here, and arithmetic that quietly cancelled one off against the other would bury it.

---

**8.8.8.8**

## How the reading was decided

![8 organisations assert a threat, 0 report it as harmless. What else reads the value: -58, four false-positive sightings from 3 orgs, hits a known-benign warninglist](img/lean-band.png)

![List of known IPv4 public DNS resolvers, category false_positive, matched by CIDR](img/warninglist.png)

*Category `false_positive` means reports about this value are usually collateral: the sample really did touch it, and it still is not the indicator. That says nothing about whether the reporting organisations were right about their incidents.*

---

**8.8.8.8**

## Every row, and where to go and check it

![The signal ledger: reporting, sightings, attribution and lifecycle groups, each row with its claim, evidence, contribution, source panel and as-of date](img/ledger.png)

> Each row carries its claim, the evidence behind it, what it contributed, the panel to go and argue with it in, and the date it was read. The last group is the page's own heading, *settled by rule, not by evidence*. It holds contradictions no signal owns, so no row quietly cancels them.

---

**8.8.8.8**

## What would change the reading

![What would change this: removal from every false_positive list; no independent corroboration for 60 more days; a galaxy cluster on any occurrence](img/what-would-change.png)

An assessment that cannot be falsified is an opinion.

The score is a sum of declared weights over declared evidence, so the engine can run it backwards and name the evidence that would move the reading, and by how much.

A signal that is linear in something countable says so, which is how the card can offer “two more organisations reporting it” where it would otherwise print a bare points gap.

---

**Same engine, same instance**

## Three more values

![google.com, asserted benign, 37](img/hero-benign.png)

*`google.com`, asserted benign. Four organisations, three sightings, and no threat assertion left standing.*

![45.155.205.233, contested, 11](img/hero-fp.png)

*`45.155.205.233`, contested by a different route: three false-positive sightings filed against a threat assertion, with no warninglist involved.*

![An md5, asserted threat, 19](img/hero-threat.png)

*An md5, asserted threat. Three organisations and galaxy attribution, but a thin sighting history. A confident lean with a low number behind it is an honest pair of readings.*

---

**The signals**

## Twelve shipped, five groups

| Signal | Group | What it reads | Default points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reporting.independent_orgs` | Reporting | distinct organisations holding an occurrence | `per_org 7`, `cap 28` |
| `reporting.published_ratio` | Reporting | published events versus drafts | `scale 9`, `none −2` |
| `sightings.volume_recency` | Sightings | sighting count, org spread, recency | `cap 24`, `none_recent −4` |
| `sightings.false_positive` lean | Sightings | false-positive sightings and their org spread | `per −3`, `per_extra_org −4`, `cap −26` |
| `attribution.galaxy` | Attribution | galaxy clusters on this value's own occurrences | `per_cluster 7`, `cap 21`, `absent −7` |
| `attribution.technique` | Attribution | ATT&CK techniques | `per_technique 3`, `cap 9` |
| `lifecycle.warninglist` lean | Lifecycle | a warninglist hit and its category | `no_hit 6`, `false_positive_hit −38`, `known_hit 0` |
| `lifecycle.feeds` | Lifecycle | presence in enabled feeds | `per_feed 4`, `cap 8`, `no_feed −2` |
| `lifecycle.continuity` | Lifecycle | months without a gap in activity | `per_month 1`, `cap 12` |
| `lifecycle.recency` | Lifecycle | how recently it was reported | `recent 8`, `old −4` |
| `record.temporal_precision` | Lifecycle | `first_seen` presence, encoding lag | `dated 4`, `undated −6` |
| `enrichment.answer` lean | Enrichment | stored answers from enrichment modules | `per_verdict 12`, `cap 24` |

> `known_hit` is zero by design. A `known`-category hit says the value is shared infrastructure, which is a different claim from harmless. The row belongs on the page and counts for neither side, and a conflict rule is what names its contradiction with wide reporting.

---

**The contract**

## What a signal hands back

Only the signal knows how to say *“53 sightings from 6 orgs, last 27 days ago”* and put *“3 in the last 30 days”* underneath it. So a signal returns a whole ledger row.

The implementation owns the sentence. The profile owns the points.

Points are declared threat-signed: does this evidence point at a threat, and how hard. Which way the arrow renders is the engine's problem, and it anchors the lean rows to the lean's polarity at assembly.

Quality rows keep their declared sign whatever the lean, because how much record there is stays the same question whatever the record concluded.

```json
{ "id": "reporting.independent_orgs",
  "group": "Reporting",
  "enabled": true,
  "trust_weighted": true,
  "points": { "per_org": 7, "cap": 28 },
  "config": { "named": 4 } }
```

> `points` is what evidence is worth, `config` is the implementation's thresholds. Neither has a fixed schema: each class declares its own keys, and validation runs per implementation on save.

---

**Honest states**

## Four outcomes, and a word for each

### Fired

A ledger row. The normal case.

### Silent

Evaluated, with nothing to say. A ledger that listed everything which did not happen would be unreadable.

### Could not run

Named in `not counted`, with the reason: excluded by policy, blocked by permissions, or simply no data.

### Unknown id

A profile naming a signal this instance does not have. It is named on the page rather than dropped.

Absence and exclusion are different things. A signal whose input set was emptied by an exclusion stays silent instead of firing its absence key: zero sightings because `sightings.self` removed them all is a very different value from one nobody has sighted.

> A score computed from eight of nine configured signals and presented as though nine had run would be the kind of quiet lie this feature exists to avoid. The banner still names the profile, because the profile is what weighted the assessment, imperfectly or not.

---

**Cost**

## The budget is measured in evidence time

Every signal reads one shared context, built once per assessment: the occurrence tally, the sighting rows, the tag and galaxy sets, the warninglist result, the corroboration dates. That is one query pass for twelve signals.

Each signal declares its evidence class:

- **Aggregate.** Counts and dates. Index aggregates, cheap at any cardinality, and always computed over the whole history.
- **Row.** The material a signal quotes in its prose. Rows were the cost, so rows are what a window bounds.

| Value | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | Everything. No budget in play, and no note on the page. |
| Long history | Row evidence fetched for the last 90 days, and the page says so, as profile policy, linked to the editor. |
| Too hot | Row-hungry signals are not evaluated and land in `not counted`. The assessment is computed from the signals that can still run. |

> Row caps and wall-clock budgets were rejected on determinism. The page, the simulator and the export worker all compute this, and they have to agree. A row cap scores whichever rows the query happened to return, and a stopwatch scores by server load.

---

**Configuration**

## Which profile is scoring you

![Resolution order: 1 yours, 2 your organisation, 3 instance default](img/resolution-order.png)

Nearest owner wins.

MISP asks three questions in order and takes the first answer: your own profile, then your organisation's, then the instance default. Exactly one profile is in force for any reader and value, which is what lets the page name it.

A fork is a full copy, with a fresh uuid and no memory of its parent, so an improved default never reaches one. That is why every map in a profile is an override set: a fork that overrides nothing keeps tracking what it came from.

Editing the instance default is a site-admin act. For an ordinary analyst the path is to fork, and that takes one click.

---

**Configuration**

## What a profile contains

| Section | What the analyst decides | Axis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signals` | which signals run, and what each contributes | lean + quality |
| `thresholds` | where the bands sit, and the lean's supermajority | lean + quality |
| `escalations` | named rules that emit `contested` instead of contributing points | lean |
| `exclusions` | evidence set aside *before* scoring: self-sightings, mirrored feeds, the long-history window | quality |
| `relevance` | the clock, the per-type TTLs, the precision tripwires | relevance |
| `reference` | what you believe about your sources: org trust, and which warninglists mean *shared infrastructure* rather than *false positive* | quality |
| `enrichment` | which modules this profile cares about, per type, and whether it will contact third parties | context |

Empty means “as before”. Every map is an override set, so an empty org-trust map weights all organisations equally, and the feature changes no behaviour until somebody edits something.

> A profile cannot widen instance policy; it picks enrichment modules from the set the instance already enabled. Presentation stays out of it as well, because a version bump on the object that explains a score should never mean somebody changed their default tab.

---

**Configuration**

## Five profiles ship, for five ways of working

![The Analyst Profiles index listing Incident Response & Investigation, default-v1, Disinformation & Influence, Fraud & Abuse, Risk & Reporting and SOC Triage](img/profiles-index.png)

> They are deliberately conservative. All five keep the shipped default's weights and bands, and what moves instead is shelf life and what the page shows first. Fraud & Abuse expires an IP in 14 days where Incident Response gives a hash five years, and Risk & Reporting changes no number at all. Choosing one MISP ships keeps it corrected upstream; forking freezes a copy you own.

---

**Configuration**

## The editor: every weight in one place

![The profile editor's Signals section, each signal with its points and tuning fields, and a value bench on the right](img/editor-signals.png)

*Ten sections down the left side. Each signal shows its points and its tuning, whether it is trust-weighted, which panel it reads, and whether it reads the value or weighs the record.*

---

**Configuration**

## Change a weight; see every row that moved

![Quality 59, 57 under the profile in force, plus 2. The band ruler moves from 57 to 59; 11 signals fired of 153 reachable.](img/bench-score.png)

![What moved, 2 of 11 rows: reporting.independent_orgs 28 to 24, minus 4, changed; lifecycle.longevity dash to 6, plus 6, appeared. Nine rows did not move: 57 to 59, plus 2.](img/bench-moved.png)

Put a value on the bench and it is rescored as you type, against the profile in force. Here `independent_orgs` went from 7 points an organisation to 3, worth −4, and a signal the profile did not use was switched on, worth +6.

Two of eleven rows moved. The page says which ones and by how much, before anything is saved.

> Pin a value and it follows you between profiles, so every change is judged on the same evidence.

---

**Extending**

## A new signal is a file you drop in

Nothing about the catalogue is hardcoded. The twelve shipped signals are twelve files, and a thirteenth is a thirteenth file. The code that would have held a list of them was never written.

| Directory | Holds | On upgrade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/Model/ValueSignals/` | the shipped catalogue | replaced |
| `app/Lib/ValueSignals/` | what you drop in | never touched |

> The same shape MISP already uses twice, for `Workflow`'s two module roots and the decaying-model formula directory.

1. **Discovery is not activation.** A dropped file changes no score until a profile names its id. Otherwise copying a file would move every number on the instance with nobody having edited a profile.
2. **A colliding id is refused.** The shipped signal keeps it. The alternative is two instances rendering the same ledger row from two different computations, with nothing on screen saying so.
3. **A broken file is an honest state.** Does not parse, wrong base class, `evaluate()` throws, row malformed: each is logged, skipped, and named in `not counted`. None of them takes the page down.
4. **One scan per request, and no cache.** An admin who drops a file expects the next page load to see it.
5. **Nothing in the UI ever writes one of these files.** There is no upload and no in-browser editor; signals arrive the way you already deploy code.

## Writing one

The judgement it encodes: a value first reported nine years ago and still being reported is a different thing from one that appeared last week.

The catalogue scores how *recently* a value was reported and how *continuously*. Nothing scores how long it has stood.

The two schemas are what let the editor render a form for a signal it has never seen. Without them a drop-in is only half usable, and the admin has to hand-edit JSON to configure the file they just wrote.

> Whole file: `example/LifecycleLongevity.php`

```php
class LifecycleLongevity extends ValueSignalBase
{
    public $id    = 'lifecycle.longevity';
    public $group = 'Lifecycle';
    public $reads = array('occurrences');

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->description = __('How long this has been on record.');

        // The editor builds a form from these two.
        $this->points_schema = array(
            'established' => array('type' => 'int', 'default' => 6),
            'brief'       => array('type' => 'int', 'default' => -2));
        $this->config_schema = array(
            'established_days' => array('type' => 'int',
                                        'default' => 365));
    }

    public function evaluate(array $context, array $config)
    {
        $oldest = (int)($context['occurrences']['oldest'] ?? 0);
        if ($oldest === 0) { return null; }        // silent

        $days = (int)floor(($context['now'] - $oldest) / 86400);
        $up   = $days >= $this->setting($config, 'established_days');

        return $this->row(
            $this->points($config, $up ? 'established' : 'brief'),
            sprintf(__('On record for %s'), $this->span($days)),
            __('Established once it has stood for 365 days'),
            $context,
            $this->stampAsOf($oldest, $context));
    }
}
```

## Two page loads later

![The editor's signal row for lifecycle.longevity, tagged custom and available, with number fields for established, brief and established_days](img/custom-row.png)

*The editor discovered it and built the form itself. *custom* means it was added on this instance, so a colleague reading the profile elsewhere cannot reproduce the number it contributes. *available* means this instance has it and this profile does not use it yet.*

![The ledger's Lifecycle group now carrying a row: On record for 4 years, established once it has stood for 365 days, plus 6, Occurrences, 2022-06-28](img/ledger-custom.png)

*Tick it in a profile and it scores real values in its own prose, sitting in the ledger beside the twelve MISP ships.*

---

**Where this stands**

## The gate that is still landing

`restSearch` does not filter on the assessment yet, and it cannot do it the way `excludeDecayed` filters on decay. A decay score is a formula over the attribute's own row and its last sighting, cheap enough to run per request. An assessment is eleven database statements per distinct value.

| A 10,000-attribute export | Warm |
| --- | --- |
| as MISP ships it | **136 ms** |
| with an assessment on every value | **74.9 s** |

550×, measured on a 3.9M-attribute instance, and linear: 100k extrapolates to about twelve minutes. Ninety-four per cent of it is fetching context, not arithmetic, so there is no hot spot to optimise away.

> Nobody else computes aging per request at export time either. Every TIP surveyed ages its indicators in the background, by a TTL that flips a status or by a decay curve crossing a threshold, and the exports filter on the result.

So the gate has to be a stored row, filled in by a worker under the instance default profile. Precomputing the whole value space is the expensive half: 4.8 hours for the two million values on the test instance, and 23 to 93 days on a billion-attribute one. Keeping them current afterwards is not, at roughly 1.4 hours a day.

**Which leaves a door open.** If the backfill is the problem and the steady state is not, the shape worth exploring is precomputing a **time slice**: the values active in a window, with everything else computed the first time something asks for it. The backfill becomes optional warming rather than a precondition.

> Two more questions decide it, and both are one probe each: what a relevance-only context costs, since `excludeStale` is the gate people will actually use, and whether a batched aggregate over 500 values costs like one statement or like 500.

---

**Closing**

## Try it on your own instance

- Open any value's *Assessment* tab and read the ledger before you trust the number.
- Go to *Analyst Profiles* and pick the one that matches how you work, or fork it and argue with a weight.
- Pin the values you always end up explaining, and judge every change against them.
- If the twelve do not say what your team means, the thirteenth is a file.

> Two analysts can now read the same value differently, and the system can show exactly where they parted.
